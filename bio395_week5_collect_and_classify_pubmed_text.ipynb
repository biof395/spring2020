The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switch maintenance therapy with S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine, after induction therapy with carboplatin and nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) in chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced SCC. Methods Chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced SCC received induction therapy with four cycles of carboplatin (at an area under the curve of 6, day 1 of a 28-day cycle) and nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/kg, days 1, 8, and 15). Patients who achieved disease control after induction therapy received maintenance therapy with S-1 (80 mg/m2, days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) from the start of maintenance therapy. Results Seventy-two patients with SCC were enrolled to the study. After four cycles of induction therapy, 35 (48.6%) patients achieved disease control, and 31 (43.1%) of these patients received maintenance therapy. Median PFS from the start of maintenance therapy was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval: 2.1-3.8 months). The most common toxicities of grade 3 or higher during maintenance therapy were nausea (13.3%), neutropenia (10.0%), and diarrhea (6.7%). Conclusions Switch maintenance therapy with S-1 after induction therapy with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel was associated with moderate efficacy and acceptable safety and may represent a feasible treatment option for patients with advanced SCC. \n",

From January 2008 to December 2017, 139 of 623 patients who underwent surgical resection and 60 of 186 patients who underwent chemoembolization/RF ablation in a single center were compared with respect to local tumor progression (LTP), intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), major complications, and hospital stay before and after propensity-score matching. Mean follow-up periods were similar in the chemoembolization/RF ablation and surgical resection groups (41.9 mo vs 48.4 mo). Three (5%) and 17 (28.3%) patients in the chemoembolization/RF ablation group and 12 (8.6%) and 57 (41.0%) patients in the surgical resection group showed LTP and IDR (P = .366 and P =.114, respectively). At 1, 3, and 5 years, respective DFS rates were 88.1%, 65.3%, and 49.0% for chemoembolization/RF ablation and 84.2%, 58.2%, and 46.5% for surgical resection (P = .294). Moreover, respective OS rates were 95.0%, 73.5%, and 54.0% for chemoembolization/RF ablation and 97.1%, 87.4%, and 75.0% for surgical resection (P = .055). After matching (n = 52), therapeutic outcomes remained similar (P = .370, P = .110, P = .230, and P = .760, respectively). Surgical resection was associated with higher complication rates (P = .015) and longer hospital stays (8.4 d ± 3.7 vs 16.9 d ± 7.0; P < .001). Conventional chemoembolization combined with RF ablation may be feasible for single 3-5-cm HCCs, with comparable therapeutic outcomes vs surgical resection and shorter hospital stays. \n",

Totally laparoscopic right anterior sectionectomy is technically demanding and has rarely been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with cirrhosis. Our experience in carrying out totally laparoscopic right anterior sectionectomy on four consecutive HCC patients with cirrhosis from November 2016 to August 2017 using the extraglissonian approach formed the basis of this report. All four patients had hepatitis B-related HCC. The mean operation time was 502 ± 55 minutes. All patients underwent intermittent Pringle's Maneuver with cycles of clamp/unclamp times of 15/5 minutes for the left-sided liver transection plane, and intermittent right hemihepatic vascular inflow occlusion with cycles of clamp/unclamp times of 30/5 minutes for the right-sided liver transection plane. The mean Pringle's Maneuver time was 58.8 ± 11.4 minutes and the mean right hemihepatic vascular inflow occlusion time was 66.3 ± 11.1 minutes. The mean intraoperative blood loss was 512 ± 301 mL. No patients required any blood transfusion. There was no conversion to open surgery. Postoperative complications included intra-abdominal bleeding requiring reoperation for hemostasis (n = 1), intra-abdominal collection requiring percutaneous drainage (n = 1), and right pleural effusion requiring percutaneous drainage (n = 1). There was no 90-day postoperative mortality. The mean hospital stay was 10.7 ± 2.9 days. After a median follow-up of 10 (range, 6-16) months, one patient developed HCC recurrence in the liver remnant. Totally laparoscopic right anterior sectionectomy using the extraglissonian approach was technically feasible and safe in expert hands. More data are needed to assess the long-term oncological survival outcomes. \n",

Conjugation is one such process by which the genetic material is shared from one bacterium to another. The DNA substrate is processed and prepared for transfer by a multi-protein complex called the relaxosome .The relaxosome of plasmid R1 possesses the most crucial enzyme TraI which, both nicks and unwinds the dsDNA substrate. TraI comprises 1765 residues and multiple functional domains, including those catalyzing the DNA trans-esterase (relaxase) on the dsDNA designated for a conjugative transfer and DNA helicase activities. Structural and functional studies have been reported for most of the TraI except the C-terminal domain spanning from residue 1630 to 1765. This region is the least understood part of TraI and is thought to be highly disordered and flexible. This region, being intrinsically disordered, is hypothesized to be serving as an interacting platform for other proteins involved in this DNA transfer initiation mechanism. In this work, we report the 1H, 13C, 15N resonance assignment of this region as well as the secondary structure information based on the backbone chemical shifts. \n",

The current management of a life-threatening pre-hospital pneumothorax is with a needle chest decompression, however, definitive care for a pneumothorax and/or haemothorax is still the insertion of an intercostal chest drain. The aim of this study was to seek expert opinion and consensus on the placement of ICDs in the pre-hospital emergency care setting in South Africa. A three-round modified Delphi study was undertaken with an expert panel drawn from local emergency care experts consisting of physicians and emergency medical service practitioners. Participants supplied opinion statements in round 1 under headings derived from common emerging themes found in the literature. During round 2 participants used a 9-point Likert scale to rate their consensus on each statement and in round 3 they were able to change their position based on the earlier panel distributions. A consensus percentage of 60% was set within a narrow margin of 'strongly agree' or 'strongly disagree'. A total of 22 experts took part as panel members. There were 123 opinion statements produced from round 1, of which 21 (17%) reached consensus in round 2. At the end of round 3 another four statements reached consensus, bringing the total up to 25 (20%). Definitive care of a life-threating pneumothorax and/or haemothorax must be sought emergently. The insertion of an ICD, under select conditions, may be required in the pre-hospital setting in South Africa. \n",

Even when researchers purposively seek to include PWD in studies, challenges emerge related to recruitment and retention, leading to inadequate representation and surface understandings of this population. This in turn contributes to the perpetuation of implicit and explicit health disparities that are already experienced by this population. Grounded within a qualitative, community-based participatory health research framework, we highlight challenges associated with recruiting and retaining PWD in health research, including a critical analysis of the research enterprise structure, how this disables accessible research practices for PWD, and leads to continued skepticism among PWD regarding the value of participating in research. Finally, we propose solutions to create and maintain a culture of access and inclusion as well as long-term collaborative and equity-focused partnerships. \n"

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess HAIC of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) in patients with unresectable liver metastases from CRC refractory to standard systemic chemotherapy. A total of 137 patients (85 men, 52 women; median age, 62 years; with KRAS mutation, n = 57) were recruited from seven institutions from September 2008 to December 2015. These patients were refractory to systemic chemotherapy including three cytotoxic agents (fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) with two molecular-targeted agents (bevacizumab and epidermal growth factor receptor antibody [cetuximab or panitumumab]). All patients underwent HAIC of continuous 5FU for unresectable liver metastases. Overall survival time, time to treatment failure, objective response rate, disease control rate, and incidence of adverse events to HAIC were assessed retrospectively. The median overall survival time was 4.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0-5.7 months), whereas time to treatment failure was 2.4 months (95% CI, 2.0-2.8 months). The objective overall response rate and disease control rate were 12.4 and 64%, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were observed in 2.9% of the patients (hyperbilirubinemia in 2, liver abscess in 1, and myelosuppression in 1). There were few incidences of severe adverse events to HAIC of 5FU for liver metastases from CRC refractory to standard systemic chemotherapy. Therefore, it might present as a treatment option as last-line chemotherapy. \n",

In this study, we investigated the effect of ethanol extract from the roots of this plant on metastatic melanoma, a highly aggressive skin cancer, in B16F10 melanoma cells and B16F10 cell inoculated-C57BL/6 mice. Our results showed that the ethanol extracts of Angelicae dahuricae Radix (EEAD) suppressed cell growth and induced apoptotic cell death in B16F10 cells. EEAD also activated the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway, with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and ration of Bax/Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, EEAD reduced the migration, invasion, and colony formation of B16F10 cells through the reduced expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9. In addition, in vivo results demonstrated that oral administration of EEAD inhibited lactate dehydrogenase activity, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity without weight loss in B16F10 cell inoculated-mice. Importantly, EEAD was able to markedly suppress lung hypertrophy, the incidence of B16F10 cells lung metastasis, and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in lung tissue. Taken together, our findings suggest that EEAD may be useful for managing metastasis and growth of malignant cancers, including melanoma. \n",

Lipoprotein levels were higher in PXB-cells than in the 2 other cell lines, and PXB-cells mainly released triglycerides and cholesterol as very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), similar to actual liver tissue, whereas the major lipoprotein released from the 2 hepatoma cell lines was LDL. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the gene expression levels of apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100), the apolipoprotein of VLDL/LDL, were similar in PXB-cells and HepG2 cells, while the overexpression of ApoC2, ApoC3, and ApoE, which are components of VLDL, but not LDL, was observed in PXBcells. A protein immunoassay revealed that ApoB100 levels secreted from PXB-cells and HuH-7 cells were similar; however, ApoC3 levels were higher in PXB-cells than in the two other cell lines. We also examined the anti-lipidemic activities of fenofibrate using this assay system. Fenofibrate suppressed lipoprotein production from PXB-cells in a dose-dependent manner mainly by activating the β-oxidation pathway. These results suggest that PXB-cells produce high levels of lipoproteins and are suitable for screening anti-lipidemic agents. \n",

We previously showed that human placental extract (hPE) was intramuscularly injected to ameliorates liver injury in a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH model. In the present study, we investigated the effects of hPE using dB/dB mice which exhibit obesity and insulin resistance and are thought to reproduce the pathological background of NASH. The MCD-diet induced liver atrophy accompanied by fibrosis around the liver sinusoids. hPE dose-dependently reduced the perivascular fibrosis. Moreover, αSMA-positive activated hepatic stellate cells increased in number in mice on the MCD diet, with this effect reversed by hPE treatment. hPE significantly decreased expression of Acta2, Col1a1, and Tgfb1 genes in hepatic stellate cells, and inhibited Smad phosphorylation. Moreover, hPE treatment increased the expression of the anti-oxidative genes Hmox1, Nqo1, Cat, and Sod1, and significantly enhanced nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 activity. Furthermore, hPE decreased the expression of Nox4 and attenuated the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species. These results, along with our previous study, suggest that hPE effectively ameliorates liver fibrosis in NASH. This beneficial effect may, in part, be due to suppression of hepatic stellate cell activation. \n",

Consensus guidelines recommend a multimodal approach to treatment of such tumours, with aggressive surgical resection remaining the mainstay of management. There is evidence that complete mesocolic excision (CME) of lymph nodes is associated with superior oncological outcomes including longer disease-free survival in patients with colorectal cancer than standard lymph node dissection and there is increasing evidence to suggest that the robotic approach may be superior to laparoscopic or open CME. This report discusses a robotic-assisted approach to CME with central vessel ligation (CVL) and para-aortic lymph node dissection in a case of multifocal neuroendocrine tumour of the small bowel. This report details the case of a 73-year-old male with multifocal small bowel neuroendocrine tumour. He underwent a robotic-assisted right hemicolectomy, small bowel resection, CME, CVL and para-aortic lymph node dissection. The approach described involved undertaking CME, CVL and bowel resection with a standard right hemicolectomy robotic set-up before re-docking the robot to perform the retroperitoneal para-aortic lymph node dissection. This case highlights the management of multifocal small bowel neuroendocrine tumour using a robotic approach for surgical resection and lymph node clearance. The robotic approach provides a safe and effective technique for undertaking surgical resection of small bowel neuroendocrine tumour as well as complete mesocolic excision of lymph nodes. With a change in port positions, a robotic approach can be utilised for CME/CVL as well as retroperitoneal node dissection. \n",

However, it remains largely unknown whether and how histone posttranslational modifications, especially H3K27me3, are causally linked to the maintenance of self-renewal ability in sorafenib-resistant HCC. Here, we found that NOTCH1 signaling was activated in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells and NOTCH1 activation conferred hepatoma cells sorafenib resistance through enhanced self-renewal and tumorigenecity. Besides, the overexpression of EZH2 was required for the emergence of cancer stem cells following prolonged sorafenib treatment. As such, modulating EZH2 expression or activity suppressed activation of NOTCH1 pathway by elevating the expression of NOTCH1-related microRNAs, hsa-miR-21-5p and has-miR-26a-1-5p, via H3K27me3, and consequently weakened self-renewal ability and tumorigenecity and restored the anti-tumor effects of sorafenib. Overall, our results highlight the role of EZH2/NICD1 axis, and also suggest that EZH2 and NOTCH1 pathway are rational targets for therapeutic intervention in sorafenib-resistant HCC. \n",

However, the optimal concurrent chemotherapy regimen has not been determined. The aim of our study was to assess the efficiency and tolerance of treatment with a concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu)-based regimen and a taxane-based regimen combined with radiotherapy in elderly patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). A total of 46 patients with ESCC aged older than 65 years were included in this study. The patient population was divided into two treatment groups: 24 patients who received CCRT with a 5-Fu-based regimen were allocated to the PF group, and 22 patients who received CCRT with a taxane-based regimen were allocated to the DP group. The median overall survival (OS), median progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate, and treatment-related toxicity were assessed. For patients in the PF group, the median OS time was 27.8 ± 9.1 months, and the median PFS time was 12.5 ± 2.7 months. Patients in the DP group had comparable survival outcomes, with a median OS time of 34.4 ± 6.4 months and a median PFS time of 21.1 ± 6.4 months (P = .296 and P = .115, respectively). Grade ≥3 leukocytopenia and grade ≥2 anemia occurred in 63.6% and 59.1% of patients in the DP group, respectively, and in 25.0% and 16.7% of patients in the PF group, respectively. Our results suggest that CCRT with a taxane-based regimen results in a higher incidence of treatment-related toxicity than CCRT with a 5-Fu-based regimen but comparable survival outcomes. \n",

Despite years of historical use in food supplement, traditional medicine or cosmetic products in many countries, liver toxicity has been found to be one of the severe and life threatening adverse effects in early 2000's. Such severe side effect has limited UA or its synthesized derivatives for further use clinically or commercially. In this study, extracted UA from Usnea longissima in methanol was exposed to natural sunlight for 21 days. Five photodegraded derivatives (1 to 5) with two new and three previously explored compounds were isolated and purified by column chromatography and preparative liquid chromatography. The structures of these derivatives were identified based on the data of nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, optical rotation, infrared spectrum, X-ray crystallography and/or electronic circulation dichroism. The cytotoxicity of (+)-UA and 2 to 5 in liver L02 cells and melanocytes were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Experimental results indicated that IC50 of (+)-UA in liver L02 cells and melanocytes were 24.4 and 6.9 μM respectively, while compound 2 to 5 have lower cytotoxicity with IC50 of 326.7, 1085.0, 62.7 and 152.4 μM in L02 cells and 87.7, 297.7, 60.2 and 85.0 μM in melanocytes respectively. Besides, (+)-UA and these derivatives were exposed to fix dosed of UVA or UVB. The anti-UVA/UVB activity was determined via Hoechst33342/propidium iodide double staining method, and quantified by computer linked fluorescence microscope equipped with CellsSense Dimension system. Based on analysis, Compound 2 to 5 captured prominent UVA/UVB protection capacity in both hepatocytes and melanocytes (p < .001). In addition, the effects of chemicals on tyrosinase were evaluated via Western Blot analysis. In terms of tyrosinase expression, only 2 showed significant stimulating effect (p < .05). However, the safe use of these derivatives cutaneously should be further studied. In conclusion, the photodegraded derivatives (2 to 5) of extracted UA have lower hepatotoxicity than (+)-UA and captured significant UV protection activities. \n",

It was reported that KLF7 overexpression was closely related to the progression of gastric cancer. However, the role of KLF7 in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) has not been elucidated. The aim of our study is to investigate the expression pattern of KLF7 and explore whether the KLF7 expression is correlated with unfavorable clinical outcome of patients with LAC. The protein and mRNA levels of KLF7 were examined in LAC tissues by using immunohistochemistry staining and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The prognostic role of KLF7 in patients with LAC was assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and logrank test. The effects of KLF7 on lung cancer cells were investigated through cellular experiments. KLF7 expression was elevated in LAC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. High protein level of KLF7 was correlated with larger tumor size, positive lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. Moreover, patients with LAC with higher expression level of KLF7 had poorer overall survival, and KLF7 was identified as an unfavorable independent prognosis factor. Knockdown of KLF7 can suppress the proliferation and invasion abilities of cancer cells. Our studies revealed that high KLF7 expression level was significantly associated with the poorer clinical outcomes of patients with LAC, indicating the potential role of KLF7 as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. \n",

There is no efficient antifibrotic therapy other than liver transplantation to date. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the major cellular source of matrix-producing myofibroblasts, playing a central role in the initiation and progression of liver fibrosis. Paracrine signals from resident and inflammatory cells such as hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic macrophages, natural killer/natural killer T cells, biliary epithelial cells, hepatic progenitor cells, and platelets can directly or indirectly regulate HSC differentiation and activation. Intercellular crosstalk between HSCs and those \"responded\" cells has been a critical event involved in HSC activation and fibrogenesis. This review summarizes recent advancement regarding intercellular communication between HSCs and other \"responded cells\" during liver fibrosis and experimental models of intercellular crosstalk systems, and provides novel ideas for potential antifibrotic therapeutic strategy. \n",

A retrospective review of pediatric/adolescent patients < 25 years old treated between 1991 and 2017 at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, was compared with a prospectively maintained database of adult patients. Outcome variables were compared and OS and RFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups using the log rank test and multivariable Cox models. The cohort was 94 pediatric patients and 765 adult patients. Overall, the 3-year OS rate for adult and pediatric patients respectively was 90% and 41.92% (95% CI:87%-92%)(p < 0.0001), and the 3-year RFS rate was 78% and 32% (p < 0.0001). The stage-for-stage 5-year OS rates for adult vs pediatric patients were: Stage 1-96% vs 100% (p=0.793); Stage 2-90% vs 64%(p<0.0001); Stage 3-85% vs 58%(p<0.0001); Stage 4-55% vs 16% (p<0.0001). The stage-for-stage 5-year RFS rates for adults vs children were: Stage 1-95% vs 100%; Stage 2-85% vs 55% (p=0.0002); Stage 3-73% vs 31% (p<0.0001); Stage 4-27% vs 5%(p<0.0001). Pediatric/adolescent patients had a higher risk of recurrence or death than adult patients on multivariate analysis (HR=2.312, 95% CI:1.615-3.313 (p<0.0001). Peritoneal metastasis was significantly higher in pediatric patients. (p=0.00001) CONCLUSIONS: Stage-for-stage, pediatric/adolescent patients had shorter 3- and 5-year OS and RFS rates than adult patients. Peritoneal disease and carcinomatosis was significantly higher in pediatric, adolescent and young adult patients less than 25 years. Pre-disposing conditions such as polyposis or congenital colon disease did not contribute to this difference. \n",

As a member of the Bcl-2 family of cell death-regulating factors, Bnip3 mediates mPTP opening, mitochondrial potential, oxidative stress, calcium overload, mitochondrial respiratory collapse, and ATP shortage of mitochondria from multiple cells. Recent studies have discovered that Bnip3 regulates mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial fragmentation, mitophagy, cell apoptosis, and the development of lipid disorder diseases via numerous cellular signaling pathways. In addition, Bnip3 promotes the development of cardiac hypertrophy by mediating inflammatory response or the related signaling pathways of cardiomyocytes and is also responsible for raising abnormal mitophagy and apoptosis progression through multiple molecular signaling pathways, inducing the pathogenesis and progress of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Different molecules regulate Bnip3 expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and unbalance of mitophagy in hepatocytes, which promotes the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, Bnip3 plays an important role in mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy homeostasis and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for diseases of secondary mitochondrial dysfunction. \n",

The established evaluation method could be used for clinical preoperative risk assessment and prediction of post-operation recovery. The basic patient information on height, body weight, BMI and hepatic encephalopathy of 93 HAE patients were examined. Subsequently, abdominal ultrasonography, blood coagulation and liver function tests were done on the patients. Liver function was assessed using the Child-Pugh improved grading method while nutritional status was evaluated using the European Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) method. Additional parameters including hospitalization time, the hemoglobin (HGB) level on the 3rd day after the operation, and the number of postoperative complications of HAE patients were also recorded. The NRS 2002 score was negatively correlated with body weight, body mass index (BMI)and albumin (ALB) (P<0.01), and positively correlated with the transverse and longitudinal diameters of the lesions (P<0.01). A worse grading of liver function was associated with a low ALB and a high NRS 2002 score (P<0.01). Results of the NRS 2002 score indicate that the hospitalization time of the normal nutrition group was significantly shorter than that of the malnourished group (P < 0.05). The HGB level of the control group on the 3rd day after the operation was significantly higher than that of the malnourished group (P < 0.05), and the number of postoperative complications was lower than that of malnutrition group (P < 0.05). Malnutrition is common in HAE patients. The nutritional status of HAE patients is related to many clinical factors, such as Child-Pugh classification of liver function, size of the lesion, and ALB among others. Although both BMI and ALB can be used as primary screening indicators for malnutrition in HAE patients, NRS 2002 is more reliable and prudent in judging malnutrition in HAE patients. Therefore, BMI and ALB are more suitable for preoperative risk assessment and prediction of postoperative recovery. \n",

Although the Turin criteria are well defined, the pathological features that could serve as diagnostic and prognostic factors remain controversial. Forty-nine consecutive PDTC cases were identified in a single cancer center between 2000 and 2018. We analyzed the impact of routine histopathological and immunohistochemical features and several parameters that are not routinely included in pathology reports such as the presence of atypical mitoses, the amount of necrosis, or insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA-binding protein 3 immunostaining on the survival of patients with PDTC. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Of the 49 PDTC 34 (69.4%) showed the insular pattern of growth. The median of poorly differentiated area was 95% (range, 1-100), and 30 (61.2%) patients had a predominant (>50%) insular area. The 5-year OS and DSS rates at a median follow-up of 57 months were 60.6% and 64.3%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that tumor size >4 cm, presence of atypical mitoses, Ki-67 >5%, and thyroglobulin (Tg)-negative immunostaining were associated with a higher risk of PDTC-related death. Atypical mitoses and Tg negativity were independent factors of worse DSS in multivariate analysis. Patients with insular and predominant insular areas showed a 3- and 6-fold higher risk of PDTC death when they displayed atypical mitoses. In PDTC, the presence of atypical mitoses may be helpful in identifying patients with poorer outcome and worth including in pathology reports, particularly in tumors with a dominant insular pattern of growth. Additionally, the inclusion of Tg immunostaining may be considered in a prognostic context, and not only as a diagnostic feature. \n",

In this study, lncRNA-ATB was significantly up-regulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and high lncRNA-ATB expression indicated poor prognosis. Knockdown of lncRNA-ATB suppressed NSCLC cell growth, colony formation, migration, invasion and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In vivo study showed that silencing lncRNA-ATB inhibited tumor growth. Further mechanism studies demonstrated that lncRNA-ATB was a target of miR-141-3p. MiR-141-3p expression was negatively related to lncRNA-ATB expression in NSCLC tissues. These results suggested that inhibiting lncRNA-ATB might be an approach for NSCLC treatment. \n",

This study is aimed to investigate the crosstalk between MDSCs and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells and their role in the malignant progression of OSCC. Immunochemistry (IHC) was used to investigate the expression of CD33 in 200 OSCC, 36 premalignant. CD33+ MDSCs were sorted and enriched via magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) from OSCC patients or health donor, and their phenotypes were identified by flow cytometry. With a co-culture system of MDSCs and OSCC, the effects of MDSCs on OSCC proliferation, apoptosis, migration invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and vasculogenic mimicry formation (VM) formation were assessed, respectively. Besides, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from health donor were cultured with OSCC supernatant, the level of MDSCs and expressions of Arginase (Arg-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were measured. The number of MDSCs was increased in tumor tissues of OSCC patients, and was positively related to the T stage, pathological grade, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Tumor-related MDSCs of the co-culture system promoted OSCC progression by contributing to cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as inducing EMT and VM. In turn, OSCC cells had potential to induce MDSCs differentiation from PBMCs and increase the expression of Arg-1 and iNOS. These indicated that the crosstalk between MDSCs and tumor cells facilitated the malignant progression of OSCC cells and the immune suppressive properties of MDSCs, which may provide new insights into tumor treatment on targeting tumor-associated immunosuppressive cells. \n",

Thus, establishing a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model that retains the key features of the primary tumor for each type of PC is important for appropriate evaluation. In this study, we established PDX models of hormone-naïve (D17225) and castration-resistant (B45354) PC by implanting fresh tumor samples, obtained from patients with advanced PC under the renal capsule of immune-compromised mice. Supplementation with exogenous androgens shortened the latent period of tumorigenesis and increased the tumor formation rate. The PDX models exhibited the same major genomic and phenotypic features of the disease in humans and maintained the main pathological features of the primary tumors. Moreover, both PDX models showed different outcomes after castration or docetaxel treatment. The hormone-naïve D17225 PDX model displayed a range of responses from complete tumor regression to overt tumor progression, and the development of castrate-resistant PC was induced after castration. The responses of the two PDX models to androgen deprivation and docetaxel were similar to those observed in patients with advanced PC. These new preclinical PC models will facilitate research on the mechanisms underlying treatment response and resistance. \n",

Objective: We examined patient-level factors associated with both PC and hospice referrals in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (DC). Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting/Subjects: Patients with DC hospitalized at a single tertiary center and followed for one year. Measurements: We assessed PC and hospice referrals during follow-up and examined patient-level factors associated with the receipt of PC and/or hospice, as well as associated clinical outcomes. We also examined late referrals (within one week of death). Results: Of 397 patients, 61 (15.4%) were referred to PC, 71 (17.9%) were referred to hospice, and 99 (24.9%) were referred to PC and/or hospice. Two hundred patients (50.4%) died during the one-year follow-up. In multivariable logistic regression, referral to PC was associated with increased comorbidity burden, ascites, increased MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease)-Na score, lack of listing for liver transplant, and unmarried status. Hospice referral was associated with increased comorbidities, portal vein thrombosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. PC referrals were late in 68.5% of cases, and hospice referrals were late in 62.7%. Late PC referrals were associated with younger age and married status. Late hospice referrals were associated with younger age and recent alcohol use. Conclusions: PC and hospice is underutilized in patients with DC, and most referrals are late. Patient-level factors associated with these referrals differ between PC and hospice. \n",

Emerging studies suggest that different microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenesis of GC. In this study, we found that miRNA-192 and -215 are significantly upregulated in GC and promote cell proliferation and migration. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a well-known negative regulator in Wnt signaling, has been proved to be a target of miRNA-192 and -215. Inhibition of miRNA-192 or -215 reduced the Topflash activities and repressed the expression of Wnt signaling pathway proteins, while APC small interfering RNAs reversed the inhibitory effects, suggesting that miRNA-192 and -215 activate Wnt signaling via APC. In addition, APC mediates the cell proliferation and migration regulated by miRNA-192 and -215. Furthermore, APC is downregulated in GC tissues and negatively correlated with the expression of miRNA-192 and -215. In summary, miRNA-192 and -215 target APC and function as oncogenic miRNAs by activating Wnt signaling in GC, revealing to be potential therapeutic targets. \n",

Among the altered pathways leading to HCC, an increasing role is attributed to abnormal epigenetic regulation. Members of the Heterochromatin Protein (HP1) 1 family are key players in chromatin organisation, acting as docking sites for chromatin modifiers. Here, we inactivated HP1a in HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells and showed that HP1a participated in cell proliferation. HP1a-depleted cells have a global decrease in DNA methylation and consequently a perturbed chromatin organisation, as exemplified by the reactivation of transcription at centromeric and pericentromeric regions, eventhough the protein levels of chromatin writers depositing methylation marks, such as EZH2, SETDB1, SUV39H1, G9A and DNMT3A remained unaltered. This decrease was attributed mainly to a low S-Adenosyl Methionine level, a cofactor involved in methylation processes. Furthermore, we showed that this decrease was due to a modification in the Methionine adenosyl transferase 2A RNA  level, which modifies the ratio of MAT1A/MAT2A, two enzymes that generate SAM. Importantly, HP1a reintroduction into HP1a-depleted cells restored the MAT2A protein to its initial level. Finally, we demonstrated that this transcriptional deregulation of MAT2A in HP1a-depleted cells relied on a lack of recruitment of HP1b and HP1g to MAT2A promoter where an improper non-CpG methylation site was promoted in the vicinity of the transcription start site where HP1b and HP1g bound. Altogether, these results highlight an unanticipated link between HP1 and the SAM synthesis pathway, and emphasise emerging functions of HP1s as sensors of some aspects of liver cell metabolism. \n",

Recent reports suggested a potential role of BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) in the development of urologic tract malignancies in kidney transplant recipients. We investigated a kidney-pancreas female recipient with an history of BKPyV nephritis who developed a rapidly progressive and widely metastatic donor-derived renal carcinoma 9 years after transplantation. Histology and FISH analysis revealed a donor-derived (XY tumor cells) collecting (Bellini) duct carcinoma. The presence of BKPyV oncogenic large tumor antigen (LTag) was identified in large amount within the kidney tumor and the bowel metastases. Whole genome sequencing of the tumor confirmed multiple genome BKPyV integrations. The transplanted kidney was removed, immunosuppression was withdrawn, and recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) was administered for 3 months, inducing a complete tumor clearance, with no evidence of disease at 6-year follow-up. The immunological profiling during IL-2 therapy revealed the presence of donor-specific T cells and expanded cytokine-producing bright NK cells but no donor-specific antibodies. Finally, we found persistently elevated anti-BK virus IgG titers and a specific anti-BKPyV T cell response. This investigation showed evidence for the potential oncogenic role of BKPyV in collecting duct carcinoma in renal allografts and demonstrated that immunosuppression withdrawal and IL-2 therapy can lead to an efficient antitumor cellular mediated rejection possibly via 3 distinct mechanisms including (1) host-versus-graft, (2) host-versus-tumor and (3) anti-BKPyV responses. \n",

It also shows that elevated methylmercaptopurine may be responsible for thiopurine-induced hepatitis. This exploratory study investigates the relationship between hepatic steatosis, methylmercaptopurine and alanine transaminase. We performed a retrospective review of patients started on azathioprine treatment at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust between 2014 and 2017. There were 600 patients in total. Ninety-one patients met our inclusion criteria which were at least one ultrasound scan commenting on the appearance of the liver, liver function tests at commencement of azathioprine and liver function tests and a methylmercaptopurine level between 6 and 8 weeks after starting treatment. Of 91 patients included in our study, 32 patients (32%) were identified as having radiological hepatic steatosis on ultrasound imaging and 59 patients had no evidence of steatosis. We found a positive association between methylmercaptopurine levels and change in alanine transaminase in patients with hepatic steatosis (P < 0.001) but not in those with a normal liver on ultrasound imaging. We conclude that the higher levels of methylmercaptopurine may be a risk factor for hepatitis in patients with hepatic steatosis but not in those with a normal liver. \n",

The detection of risk factors is fundamental to identify subjects at higher risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Recent data suggested that NAFLD increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma development. However, it is necessary to better explain the strength of association between NAFLD and cholangiocarcinoma. A systematic research of current case-control, cohort, clinical trial and meta-analysis on the main electronic databases was made. A recent systematic review was recognized. We performed cumulative meta-analyses with sensitivity analysis excluding studies with large sample size and with great clinical heterogeneity, then we checked for further studies. At the final step, three trial sequential analyses were done as well. NAFLD determines an increased risk of total cholangiocarcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) development: odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]): 1.88 (1.25-2.83), OR (95% CI): 2.19 (1.48-3.25), respectively. On the contrary, NAFLD does not show a significant effect on extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA) (OR (95% CI): 1.48 (0.93-2.36). The trial sequential analyses regarding total cholangiocarcinoma and iCCA showed that z-curve was outside computed alpha boundaries, proving that the positive association was conclusive. The trial sequential analysis about eCCA showed that z-curve was inside computed futile boundaries, proving that negative results were conclusive. The performance of new sensitive analyses and the respective trial sequential analyses, after withdraw of confounding factors, suggested the existence of definitive association only between NAFLD and iCCA development and not with eCCA. \n",

We and others have observed an intimate association of neoplastic ductal cells with non-neoplastic islet cells, recapitulating the ductoinsular complex. We define this phenomenon as tumor-insular complex (TIC). Herein, we describe the clinicopathologic characteristics of TIC in neoadjuvant treated PDAC cases for the first time. We retrospectively reviewed the pathology of 105 cases of neoadjuvant treated PDAC resected at our institution. TIC was noted in 35 cases (33.3%), the mean tumor bed size was 2.7±1.0 cm, mean percentage of residual tumor 40±28% and mean Residual Tumor Index (RTI) (an index previously established as a prognostic parameter by our group) was 1.1±1.0. TIC was significantly associated with perineural invasion (P=0.001), higher tumor bed size (P=0.007), percentage of residual tumor (P=0.009), RTI (P=0.001), ypT stage (P=0.045), and poor treatment response, grouped by a previously established criteria (P=0.010). Using our prior binary reported prognostic cutoff for RTI of ≤0.35 and >0.35, TIC was associated with a RTI >0.35 (P=0.002). Moreover, patients who did not receive neoadjuvant radiation were associated with a higher frequency of TIC (P=0.003). In this cohort, RTI but not TIC was also shown to be a significant independent prognosticator for recurrence-free survival and overall survival on multivariate analysis. In conclusion, TIC is significantly associated with a more aggressive neoplasm which shows a poor treatment response. Further studies will be needed to better understand the tumor biology of TICs. \n",

GC patient tissues show significantly higher SERPINH1 mRNA and protein levels than normal gastric mucosal tissues. GC patients with high SERPINH1 expression are associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. SERPINH1 mRNA levels negatively correlate with E-cadherin mRNA levels and positively correlate with levels of N-cadherin, MMP2, and MMP9 mRNA levels. This suggests SERPINH1 regulates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). SERPINH1 expression was significantly higher in the HGC-27, AGS, MGC-803, and SGC-7901 GC cell lines than in the GES-1 normal gastric mucosal cell line. In SERPINH1-silenced SGC-7901 cells, survival, colony formation, migration and invasion were all reduced, whereas they were all enhanced in SERPINH1-overexpressing MGC-803 cells. Levels of WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway proteins, including β-catenin, Wnt2, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β, NF-κB P65, Snail1, Slug and TWIST, were all reduced in SERPINH1-silenced SGC-7901 cells, and increased in the SERPINH1-overexpressing MGC-803 cells. Inhibition of SERPINH1 protein using Co1003 significantly decreased survival, invasion, and migration of GC cells. SERPINH1 thus appears to regulate EMT and GC progression via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, making SERPINH1 a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in GC patients. \n",

Despite of the progression in treatment, the prognosis remains extremely poor for HCC patients. The mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis are complex, of which fibrosis is acknowledged as the pre-cancerous stage of HCC. Approximately, 80-90% of HCC develops in the fibrotic or cirrhotic livers. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main effector cells of liver fibrosis, could secret various biological contents to maintain the liver inflammation. By decades, HSCs are increasingly correlated with HCC in the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we summarized the underlying mechanisms that HSCs participated in the genesis and progression of HCC. HSCs secret various bioactive contents and regulate tumor-related pathways, subsequently contribute to metastasis, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, chemoresistance and cancer stemness. The study indicates that HSC plays vital roles in HCC progression, suggesting it as a promising therapeutic target for HCC treatment. \n",

Herein, a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform (PFP@MPDA-DOX) based on perfluoropentane (PFP) encapsulated mesoporous polydopamine (MPDA) is elaborately designed, followed by gating of drug doxorubicin (DOX) for preventing cargo leaking. The MPDA with pH-responsive biodegradation behavior was served as nanocarrier, which also endows the nanoplatform with a large cavity for PFP filling. The nanoparticles were then gated with DOX molecule by Michael addition and/or Schiff base reaction to shield the leaking of PFP during the blood circulation before the tumor tissue is reached. Also, such nanotheranostic exhibits high photothermal conversion efficiency of 45.6%, which can act as an intelligent nanosystem for photothermal therapy (PTT) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Moreover, the liquid-gas phase transition of PFP arising upon exposure to an 808 nm laser and thus produced the bubbles for ultrasound (US) imaging. The subsequent PFP@MPDA-DOX-mediated synergetic chemotherapy (contributed by the DOX gatekeeper) and PTT (contributed by the MPDA) shows excellent anticancer activity, which has been systematically evaluated both in vitro and in vivo.

Immunohistochemical staining for NSD2 was carried out on specimen obtained from palliative resection of the prostate. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the association between NSD2 expression and PCa progression.Results: Of the 53 patients, 41 had castration-resistant PCa and 48 men had metastases at time of tissue acquisition. NSD2 expression was increased in tumour specimen from 42 patients (79.2%). In univariable Cox regression analyses, NSD2 expression was associated with PSA progression, progression on imaging and overall survival (p = 0.04, respectively). In multivariable analyses, NSD2 expression did not retain its association with these endpoints.Conclusions: NSD2 expression is abnormal in almost 80% of patients with advanced PCa. Expression levels of this epigenetic regulator are easily detected by immunohistochemistry while this biomarker exhibited prognostic value for PCa progression and death in univariable analysis. Further studies on NSD2 involvement in PCa proliferation, progression, metastasis and resistance mechanisms are needed. \n",

Existing treatment methods are not effective enough due to its high occurrence of metastasis. Therefore, identification of effective therapeutic targets is becoming increasingly important. In this research, lncRNA Dopamine β hydroxylase antisense RNA 1 (DBH-AS1) was found to be upregulated in DLBC tissues and cells. Knockdown of DBH-AS1 suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells. Afterwards, RBP BUD13 homolog (BUD13) was found to be upregulated in cancer tissues and cells while binding to DBH-AS1. Fibronectin 1 (FN1) was the downstream mRNA of BUD13. FN1 was upregulated in DLBC and was positively correlated with DBH-AS1. Further rescue assays proved that DBH-AS1 mediated FN1 expression by recruiting BUD13. In the meantime, BUD13 stabilized FN1 mRNA to promote FN1 expression. In this way DBH-AS1/BUD13/FN1 axis was confirmed. A set of rescue assays proved that DBH-AS1 regulated DLBC progression via BUD13 and FN1. The function and mechanism of DBH-AS1 was investigated for the first time in DLBC.

The study included 91 patients with BMs who had been treated with WBRT and/or GK between 2014 and 2017. The patients with BMs were retrospectively evaluated regarding age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, basic score for BM (BS-BM), Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) index, primary tumour type, extracranial metastases, primary tumour control, number of BMs, and brain metastasectomy. A univariate analysis of the OS was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, supplemented by the log-rank test. We also applied a multivariate survival analysis using the Cox regression model. The median OS for all patients with BMs was 6 months. Meanwhile, the median OSs for those with WBRT, GK, and WBRT-GK treatment were 6, 4, and 15 months, respectively (p = 0.00). In the multivariate analysis, the female sex (p = 0.030), brain metastasectomy (p = 0.047), treatment with WBRT-GK (p = 0.001), and the controlled primary tumour (p = 0.007) significantly correlated with the OS. Furthermore, the BS-BM (p = 0.022) was closely related with the OS compared to the RPA and DS-GPA in the multivariate analysis. The BS-BM was found to better predict the survival of patients with BMs according to the prognostic index scores in the multivariate analysis.

It is also the fourth most common cause of cancer-associated deaths globally. The role of nucleus accumbens associated protein-1 (NACC-1) has been evaluated in several cancers. This protein is a transcriptional regulator that regulates a number of significant cellular processes. In the current study, we aimed to understand the role of NACC-1 in HCC. Primarily, we measured the expression of NACC-1 using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. We knocked down the expression of NACC-1 in HCC cell lines Huh7 and HepG2 by transferring a commercially synthesized small interfering RNA and explored the impact of NACC-1 knockdown on cellular growth, migration, invasion, and chemoresistance to doxorubicin. Through bioinformatic analysis, we identified NACC-1 as a potential target of miR-760. Using a dual reporter luciferase assay, we confirmed the predicted target and assessed miR-760-mediated regulation of NACC-1 and rescue of tumorigenic phenotypes. We observed increased expression of NACC-1 in HCC. Furthermore, knockdown of NACC-1 resulted in reduced cell proliferation and invasion and increased susceptibility to doxorubicin-mediated chemosensitivity. Overexpression of miR-760 in HCC cell lines rescued NACC-1-mediated migration and invasion. We revealed that miR-760 regulated NACC-1 expression in HCC. Our data indicated that both miR-760 and NACC-1 could be used as prognostic markers, and miR-760 may have therapeutic benefits for HCC and other cancers. \n",

The median overall survival (OS) was 30 months, with the 2-, 3- and 5-year OS of 57%, 50% and 30%, respectively. OS was significantly related to lymph node involvement (P = 0.04), size of the primary tumour (P < 0.001), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.02) and the time period between metastasis diagnosis and primary tumour removal (P = 0.04). Multidisciplinary approach is the gold standard in OM patients. Patients with no lymph node involvement are the best candidates, with an acceptable OS. Thus, patients with OM-NSCLC should not be excluded from surgery as a matter of principle. \n",

Localized ccRCC has a favorable surgical outcome. However, one third of ccRCC patients will develop metastases to the lung, which is related to a very poor outcome for patients. Unfortunately, no therapy is available for this deadly stage, because the molecular mechanism of metastasis remains unknown. It has been known for 25 years that the loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is pathognomonic of ccRCC. However, no clinically relevant transgenic mouse model of ccRCC has been generated. The purpose of this protocol is to introduce and compare two newly established animal models for metastatic ccRCC. The first is renal implantation in the mouse model. In our laboratory, the CRISPR gene editing system was utilized to knock out the VHL gene in several RCC cell lines. Orthotopic implantation of heterogeneous ccRCC populations to the renal capsule created novel ccRCC models that develop robust lung metastases in immunocompetent mice. The second model is the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) system. In comparison to the mouse model, this model is more time, labor, and cost-efficient. This model also supported robust tumor formation and intravasation. Due to the short 10 day period of tumor growth in CAM, no overt metastasis was observed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the collected embryo tissues. However, when tumor growth was extended by two weeks in the hatched chicken, micrometastatic ccRCC lesions were observed by IHC in the lungs. These two novel preclinical models will be useful to further study the molecular mechanism behind metastasis, as well as to establish new, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) toward the development of novel treatments for metastatic ccRCC. \n",

The continuous angiogenesis plays a key role in the growth, invasion, and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while the diagnostic and prognostic roles of AGGF1 for HCC need to be further studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS The mRNA sequencing datasets and clinical features of HCC patients were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The relationship between clinical features and AGGF1 expression was analyzed by Wilcoxon test. Further validation explorations were carried out using online database Oncomine. The diagnostic receiver operating characteristic curves of AGGF1 and alpha-fetoprotein were compared to examine the diagnostic efficacy of AGGF1. Survival analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were performed to explore the prediction value and potential mechanism of AGGF1 dysregulation in HCC. RESULTS Comprehensive overexpression of AGGF1 was observed in HCC, correlating with poor overall survival. Upregulated level of AGGF1 was statistically associated with poor differentiated histological grade, advanced cancer stage and T classification. AGGF1 was a more effective diagnostic marker than alpha-fetoprotein in HCC. Several important pathways related to HCC including pathway in cancer and P53 signaling pathway were differentially enriched in the high AGGF1 expression phenotype. CONCLUSIONS AGGF1 was a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for poor clinical outcomes in HCC patients. Moreover, vital pathways regulated by AGGF1 in HCC may include regulation of autophagy, Wnt signaling pathway, pathway in cancer, cell cycle, and P53 signaling pathway. \n",

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are well known as a class of transcripts involved in cancer occurrence and progression. The process of epithelial to a mesenchymal (EMT) phenotype in tumor cell increases their migratory and invasive properties, resulting in facilitating metastasis. Here, we reanalyzed RNA-seq data from the TCGA PC database and identified that ENSG00000254041.1 increasingly expressed in samples with elevated EMT signature score. Then, the evaluated expression and prognostic significance of ENSG00000254041.1 were verified in our cohort. Meanwhile, multivariate analysis suggested that ENSG00000254041.1 was independent factors for predicting the prognosis of PC, apart from advanced stage (III/IV). Moreover, functional assay revealed that knock down of ENSG00000254041.1 significantly decreased proliferation, invasion and chemoresistance of PC cells (SW1990 and BxPC-3), while overexpression of ENSG00000254041.1 in PC cells (Panc-1) resulted in the opposite effects. Western blot showed that knockdown of ENSG00000254041.1 expression in PC cells caused a significant downregulation of vimentin, Snail and SOX4, and upregulation of E-cadherin; also, ENSG00000254041.1 overexpression in PC cells resulted in opposite effects. In conclusion, these findings indicated that ENSG00000254041.1 promotes PC progression, and might provide a potential biomarker for predicting the prognosis of PC. \n",

Chemical inhibition of DDR1 phosphorylation or DDR1 mRNA silencing reduced AKT and ERK phosphorylation, expression of ICAM1 and VCAM1, Ki67 and secretion of MMP9. DDR1 silenced cells showed reduced adhesion to collagen type I, MMP-dependent invasion, and chemotactic and proliferative responses to collagen type I.

Evaluation of toxicity and efficacy.\tObjective: To compare radiation-induced toxicity and dosimetry parameters in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer (LANPC) treated with a mixed-beam (MB) approach (IMRT followed by proton therapy boost) with an historic cohort of patients treated with a full course of IMRT-only.Material and methods: Twenty-seven patients with LANPC treated with the MB approach were compared to a similar cohort of 17 patients treated with IMRT-only. The MB approach consisted in a first phase of IMRT up to 54-60 Gy followed by a second phase delivered with a proton therapy boost up to 70-74 Gy (RBE). The total dose for patients treated with IMRT-only was 69.96 Gy. Induction chemotherapy was administrated to 59 and 88% and concurrent chemoradiotherapy to 88 and 100% of the MB and IMRT-only patients, respectively. The worst toxicity occurring during the entire course of treatment (acute toxicity) and early-late toxicity were registered according to the Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events V4.03.Results: The two cohorts were comparable. Patients treated with MB received a significantly higher median total dose to target volumes (p = .02). Acute grade 3 mucositis was found in 11 and 76% (p = .0002) of patients treated with MB and IMRT-only approach, respectively, while grade 2 xerostomia was found in 7 and 35% (p = .02) of patients treated with MB and IMRT-only, respectively. There was no statistical difference in late toxicity. Local progression-free survival (PFS) and progression-free survival curves were similar between the two cohorts of patients (p = .17 and p = .40, respectively). Local control rate was 96% and 81% for patients treated with MB approach and IMRT-only, respectively.Conclusions: Sequential MB approach for LANPC patients provides a significantly lower acute toxicity profile compared to full course of IMRT. There were no differences in early-late morbidities and disease-related outcomes (censored at two-years) but a longer follow-up is required to achieve conclusive results. \n",

The two aims of the present study were (1) to determine how aging affects liver health in mice in the absence of any interventions and (2) if degenerations observed in relation to blood endotoxin levels are critical in aging-associated liver degeneration. Endotoxin levels and markers of liver damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, insulin resistance and apoptosis as well as the toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr-4) signaling cascade were studied in liver tissue and blood, respectively, of 3 and 24 months old male C57BL/6J mice. In a second set of experiments 3-4 and 14 months old female lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) -/- mice and littermates fed standard chow, markers of liver damage, insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction were assessed. Plasma activity of aspartate aminotransferase and histological signs of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis were significantly higher in old C57BL/6J mice than in young animals. Number of neutrophils, CD8α-positive cells and mRNA expression of markers of apoptosis were also significantly higher in livers of old C57BL/6J mice when compared to young animals being also associated with a significant induction of hepatic Tlr-4 and LBP expression as well as higher endotoxin levels in peripheral blood. Compared to age-matched littermates, LBP -/- mice display less signs of senescence in liver. Taken together, our data suggest that, despite being fed standard chow, old mice developed liver inflammation and beginning fibrosis and that bacterial endotoxin may play a critical role herein. \n",

Between 2002 and 2017, percutaneous RFA was performed on 94 metachronous hepatic metastases (median diameter, 1.5 cm) arising from pancreatic cancer in 60 patients (mean age, 60.5 years). Patients were included if they had fewer than five metastases, a maximum tumor diameter of ≤ 5 cm, and disease confined to the liver or stable extrahepatic disease. For comparisons during the same period, we included 66 patients who received chemotherapy only and met the same eligibility criteria described. Technical success was achieved in all hepatic metastasis without any procedure-related mortality. During follow-up, local tumor progression of treated lesions was observed in 38.3% of the tumors. Overall median survival and 3-year survival rates were 12 months and 0%, respectively from initial RFA, and 14.7 months and 2.1%, respectively from the first diagnosis of liver metastasis. Multivariate analysis showed that a large tumor diameter of > 1.5 cm, a late TNM stage (≥ IIB) before curative surgery, a time from surgery to recurrence of < 1 year, and the presence of extrahepatic metastasis, were all prognostic of reduced overall survival after RFA. Median overall (12 months vs. 9.1 months, p = 0.094) and progression-free survival (5 months vs. 3.3 months, p = 0.068) were higher in the RFA group than in the chemotherapy group with borderline statistical difference. RFA is safe and may offer successful local tumor control in patients with metachronous hepatic metastases arising from pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with a small diameter tumor, early TNM stage before curative surgery, late hepatic recurrence, and liver-only metastasis benefit most from RFA treatment. RFA provided better survival outcomes than chemotherapy for this specific group with borderline statistical difference. \n",

In this retrospective study, 99 patients were enrolled, who underwent CBCT-HA during initial chemoembolization for HCC suspected on CT. All patients underwent chemoembolization and regular clinical and imaging follow-up for two years. If IDR appeared on follow-up imaging, initial CBCT-HA images were reviewed to determine if a hypervascular focus pre-existed at the site of recurrence. Pre-existing hypervascular foci on CBCT-HA were regarded as HCCs in initial presentation. Initial HCCs were classified into three groups according to their mode of detection (Group I, detected on CT and CBCT-HA; Group II, additionally detected on CBCT-HA; Group III, confirmed by interval growth). We assessed the influence of CBCT-HA and two-year follow-up on initial tumor stage and calculated the proportion of IDR that pre-existed in initial CBCT-HA. A total of 405 nodules were confirmed as HCCs, and 297 nodules initially pre-existed. Of the initial 297 HCCs, 149 (50.2%) lesions were in Group I, 74 (24.9%) lesions were in Group II, and the remaining 74 (24.9%) lesions were in Group III. After applying CBCT-HA findings, 11 patients upstaged in T stage, and 4 patients had a change in Milan criteria. Our reference standard for HCC indicated that 120 of 148 (81.1%) one-year IDR and 148 of 256 (57.8%) two-year IDR existed on initial CBCT-HA. The proposed method enabled the confirmation of many sub-centimeter-sized, faintly vascularized HCC nodules that pre-existed initially but clinically manifested as IDR. Our reference standard for HCC helped in understanding the nature of IDR and the early development of HCC as well as the clinical impact of tumor staging and treatment decision. \n",

In this retrospective study, 134 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 56.8 ± 10.0 years) with 151 arterial enhancing-only nodules measuring up to 2 cm during multiphasic CT that were subsequently evaluated using gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in treatment-naïve at-risk patients from three tertiary referral centers were included. Tentative diagnostic criteria for HCC and hepatic malignancy were defined as the presence of one of eight MRI features favoring HCC in combinations of the following sequences: T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), T1-weighted dual gradient-echo in-phase and out-of-phase imaging (Dual-GRE), and hepatobiliary phase imaging (HBP). Typical hemangiomas and arterioportal shunts were excluded from the analysis. Diagnostic performance for HCC and hepatic malignancy was calculated and compared between the abbreviated MRI and full-sequence gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. Of 151 nodules (mean size, 1.2 cm) 68 HCCs and 83 non-HCC benignities and malignancies were included. The combination of T2WI, DWI, and Dual-GRE showed per-lesion sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 88.2%, 90.4%, and 89.4%, respectively, comparable to those of full-sequence MRI. Applying the same sequence combination to diagnose hepatic malignancy had per-lesion sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 86.8%, 97.3%, and 92.1%. In nodules < 1 cm, adding HBP increased sensitivity by up to 13% without compromising the specificity or accuracy. The non-contrast MRI protocol comprising T2WI, DWI, and Dual-GRE showed reasonable and comparable performance to full-sequence MRI for discriminating HCC and primary liver malignancies in CT-detected indeterminate arterial enhancing-only nodules in at-risk patients, and can be potentially used for sequential imaging in place of a full-sequence MRI. In nodules < 1 cm, HBP may still be needed to preserve sensitivity. \n",

Recently, adult liver-derived liver organoids are found to be of much interest due to their genetic stability, expansion potential, and ability to differentiate toward a hepatocyte-like fate. The current standard for culturing these organoids is a basement membrane hydrogel like Matrigel (MG), which is derived from murine tumor material and apart from its variability and high costs, possesses an undefined composition and is therefore not clinically applicable. Here, a cellulose nanofibril (CNF) hydrogel is investigated with regard to its potential to serve as an alternative clinical grade scaffold to differentiate liver organoids. The results show that its mechanical properties are suitable for differentiation with overall, either equal or improved, functionality of the hepatocyte-like cells compared to MG. Therefore, and because of its defined and tunable chemical definition, the CNF hydrogel presents a viable alternative to MG for liver tissue engineering with the option for clinical use. \n",

Between June 2016 and December 2017, 141 patients with mNPC who received platinum-based systemic chemotherapy were included (median follow-up time, 21 months). Patients were classified into two groups according to the administration of oral maintenance chemotherapy. Plasma samples were collected before, during, and after treatment for the measurement of circulating EBV DNA. The 2-year OS was higher for patients who received maintenance chemotherapy than for patients without maintenance chemotherapy (78.9% vs 62.7%, P = .016). Patients with undetectable posttreatment EBV-DNA after 4-6 cycles of systemic chemotherapy (n = 73) had a higher 2-year OS than that of patients with detectable EBV-DNA (n = 68) (82.16% vs 51.45%, P = .001). For patients with undetectable posttreatment EBV-DNA, OS was better for those with maintenance chemotherapy than for those without (86.7% vs 73%, P = .027). For patients with detectable posttreatment EBV-DNA, maintenance chemotherapy did not improve outcomes (49.5% vs 55.4%, P = .824). The most common acute events were hematological toxicity, and all were tolerable and curable. Oral maintenance chemotherapy with S1 or capecitabine can improve OS in mNPC.

In a retrospective occupational cohort who underwent annual/biennial health examinations (between 2002 and 2015), subjects were excluded with known chronic liver disease. Based on their baseline FIB-4 and APRI scores, subjects were categorised in low/intermediate/high risk groups for advanced liver fibrosis. Using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated for liver cancer mortality, with the low risk FIB-4/APRI group as the reference.

High baseline FIB-4 or APRI scores occurred in 0.25% and 0.09% of subjects, respectively. A high FIB-4 or APRI score was associated with a markedly increased risk of liver cancer mortality (aHRs 629.10 [95% CI 228.74-1730.20]; and 80.42 [95% CI 34.37-188.18]), respectively.

The aim of this multicenter study was to compare the outcomes of transplanted cirrhotic patients with iCCA or cHCC-CCA found incidentally in the native liver, versus those of patients with the same tumors undergoing liver resection (LR). Patients with histologically confirmed iCCA/cHCC-CCA ≤5 cm in the setting of cirrhosis who underwent LR or LT in three tertiary centers between 2002 and July 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Forty-nine LT patients (65%) were compared to twenty-six LR patients (35%). Tumor recurrence was significantly lower among LT patients (18% vs 46%; p=0.01), Independent predictive factors for tumor recurrence were the median diameter of the largest nodule (HR 1.07 [95%Cl 1.02-1.12]; p=0.006) and tumor differentiation (HR 3.74 [95%CI 1.71-8.17]; p=0.001). Five-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was significantly higher in the LT group (75% vs 36%; p=0.004). In the subgroup of patients with tumors larger than 2 cm but less than 5 cm, the recurrence rate was lower in the LT group (21% vs 48%; p=0.06). Independent risk factors for recurrence were: LT (protective) (HR 0.23 [95%CI 0.07-0.82]; p=0.02), the median diameter of the largest nodule (HR 1.097 [95%CI 1.02-1.73]; p=0.007) and tumor differentiation (HR 4.16 [95%CI 1.37-12.66]; p=0.01). Five-year RFS was higher in LT patients (74% vs 40%; p=0.06). In the LT group, 5-year survival reached 69% and 65% (p=0.40) in patients with tumors ≤2 cm and >2-5 cm, while survival was also comparable between iCCA and cHCC-CCA patients (p=0.29). LT may offer a curative strategy for highly selected patients with unresectable iCCA/cHCC-CCA in the setting of cirrhosis and tumors smaller than 5 cm.

In the preliminary work of the laboratory, found that miR-383-5p was down-regulated in the liver tissue of acute cold stress rats and has been shown to be an important regulatory factor in tumour proliferation, but there are very few studies involving the mediation of cold stress in rat liver tissues. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of miR-383-5p on the livers of cold stress rats by simulating the cold stress state of rat liver tissues in vitro using H2 O2 to induce rat hepatocyte oxidative stress. The results showed that MDA content, Caspase 3 and Cyto C protein levels increased significantly; GPx activity and SOD1 protein levels decreased significantly and miR-383-5p expression was significantly down-regulated in rat liver tissues after cold stress. Different concentrations of H2 O2 was added to rat hepatocytes, and the results showed that the expression of miR-383-5p, the ROS level, and the apoptosis rate in rat hepatocytes was increased significantly in a concentration-dependent fashion. Transfection of miR-383-5p inhibitor revealed that the apoptosis rate of rat hepatocytes, and the protein level of apoptosis-related protein Caspase 3 were reduced; the results of the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-383-5p targeted regulation of Bcl2. The results suggested that the expression of miR-383-5p was up-regulated in oxidative stress rat hepatocytes and may aggravate the apoptosis of rat hepatocytes induced by targeting inhibition of Bcl2 translation. \n",

This study examines endoscopic and surgical outcomes, histological assessment of submucosal (sm) disease, factors influencing LN metastasis, and the safety of treating pT1b disease endoscopically. Histopathological reexamination recorded thickness, width and depth of sm invasion, grade, presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), resection margin status and tumor stage. Multivariate analysis was employed to evaluate the factors influencing survival and LN metastasis. Rate of LN metastasis for pT1 low-risk (LR: sm invasion < 500 μm, G1-2, no LVI) or high-risk (HR: sm invasion >500 μm, G3-4 or LVI) disease were analyzed. Ninety three patients underwent ER and 96 underwent esophagectomy. We demonstrate conflicting histological methods of sm disease reporting, which may explain the difference in LN metastasis rate between reported surgical & endoscopic series. Multivariate analysis confirmed age, T stage, and presence of LN metastases were the independent factors predicting poor prognosis. Tumor thickness as well as grade, T stage, LVI were predictors of LN metastasis. Rates of LN metastasis are <2% in LR sm1 disease, and >15% in HR sm1 disease. Pathological reporting of sm invasion should be updated for uniform analysis of endoscopic and surgical specimens. Following rigorous histopathological examination and within a close endoscopic follow-up regimen, pT1a and pT1b LRsm1 disease may be treated with curative intent endoscopically, whereas pT1b HRsm1-sm3 disease should be offered surgery. \n",

A great achievement in the treatment of CRC was the introduction of targeted biological drugs and solutions of chemotherapy, combined with hyperthermia. Cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) extends the patients' survival with CRC. Recently, gene therapy approaches are also postulated. The studies indicate the possibility of enhancing the gene transfer to cells by recombinant adeno-associated vectors (rAAV) at hyperthermia. The rAAV vectors arouse a lot of attention in the field of cancer treatment due to many advantages. In this study, the effect of elevated temperature on the transduction efficiency of rAAV vectors on CRC cells with different origin and gene profile was examined. The effect of heat shock on the penetration of rAAV vectors into CRC cells in relation with the expression of HSP and AAV receptor genes was tested. It was found that the examined cells under hyperthermia (43°C, 1 h) are transduced at a higher level than in normal conditions (37°C). The results also indicate that studied RKO, HT-29, and LS411N cell lines express HSP genes at different levels under both 37°C and 43°C. Moreover, the results showed that the expression of AAV receptors increases in response to elevated temperature. The study suggests that increased rAAV transfer to CRC can be achieved under elevated temperature conditions. The obtained results provide information relevant to the design of new solutions in CRC therapy based on the combination of hyperthermia, chemotherapy, and gene therapy. \n",

In this study, we evaluated the association of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1050244 in miRNA target site of DDB2 gene with risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among 1073 HCC patients and 1119 cancer-free controls in a southern Chinese population. Our results showed that no statistically significant association was found between DDB2 rs1050244 and HCC risk. In further analysis stratified by age, sex, smoking, alcohol drinking, and HBV infection status, we found that individuals carrying the CT/TT genotypes of SNP rs1050244 had a significantly decreased risk of HCC compared with those with the CC genotype among non-HBV infected population (adjusted OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.13-0.72), and a significant interaction was found between this SNP and HBV infection (Pinteraction=0.002). Our results suggested that the DDB2 rs1050244 C>T polymorphism was associated with the decreased risk of HCC among non-HBV infected population. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate our findings. \n",

Kinesin family member 22 (KIF22), also called as kinesin-like DNA binding protein (KID), is a microtubule-based motor protein and binds to both microtubules and chromosomes, transporting organelles, protein, and mRNA. This research aimed at investigating the prognostic significance of KIF22 in TSCC. Patients and Methods. This retrospective research collected 82 paired tissues with TSCC. KIF22 protein expression level was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Suppression of KIF22 with shRNA in CAL-27 and SCC-15 cells was to observe cell proliferation in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. In TSCC tissues, the protein expression level of KIF22 was increased and correlated with tumor stage, clinical stage, and lymphatic metastasis (P=0.013, P=0.013, P=0.013.

These RNAs are involved in the development and progression of various cancers, but their roles in gastric cancer have not yet been thoroughly elucidated. This study showed that hsa_circ_0000467 expression was higher in gastric cancer tissues than in corresponding adjacent tissues (P < 0.050) and that hsa_circ_0000467 expression levels were correlated with gastric cancer histological grade (P < 0.050). In addition, hsa_circ_0000467 was remarkably upregulated in gastric cancer cell lines (P < 0.001). Cell function experiments indicated that hsa_circ_0000467 downregulation decreased the proliferation and invasion ability of BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells and the number of cells entering the G2/M phase. A direct binding interaction was detected between hsa_circ_0000467 and miR-326-3p by dual-luciferase reporter assays. In addition, the results showed that inhibition of miR-326-3p reversed the decreases in the proliferation and invasion of BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells caused by hsa_circ_0000647 downregulation. Inhibition of miR-326-3p also decreased the number of cells entering the G2/M phase and the expression of cyclin D1. In conclusion, hsa_circ_0000467 plays a regulatory role in the development and progression of gastric cancer by regulating miR-326-3p, and this circRNA may be a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of gastric cancer. \n",

The aim of this study was to identify genes associated with the metastasis of PCPG. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) expression profile data and clinical information were downloaded from the cbioportal, and the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted. The gene coexpression modules were extracted from the network through the WGCNA package of R software. We further extracted metastasis-related modules of PCPG. Enrichment analysis of Biological Process of Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes was carried out for important modules, and survival analysis of hub genes in the modules was performed. A total of 168 PCPG samples were included in this study. The weighted gene coexpression network was constructed with 5125 genes of the top 25% variance among the 20501 genes obtained from the database. We identified 11 coexpression modules, among which the salmon module was associated with the age of PCPG patients at diagnosis, metastasis, and malignancy of the tumors.

Microbubble-enhanced ultrasound (MEUS) can noninvasively disrupt and block the tumor blood perfusion and has the potential to overcome the heat sink effect and enhance the therapeutic effect of MWA. The study aimed at evaluating the potential additional benefit of microbubble-enhanced ultrasound (MEUS) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by microwave ablation (MWA). In this study, a new strategy of combining MWA with MEUS for treating HCC was proposed. Twenty-four rabbits with VX2 tumors in livers were randomly divided into MEUS + MWA, MEUS alone, MWA alone, and blank control groups, respectively (n = 6). In the MEUS group, the tumors were directly exposed to therapeutic ultrasound for 5 min with a concurrent intravenous injection of microbubbles (0.1 ml/kg diluted into 5 ml saline). In the MWA group, the tumors were treated by MWA for 1 min. In the MEUS + MWA group, tumors were ablated by MWA for 1 min after ultrasound cavitation enhanced by microbubbles as in the MEUS group. In the blank control group, the tumors received probe sham and intravenous saline. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was performed before treatment and immediately after treatment to display the size, shape, and contour of the tumors. Throughout the treatment process, the local temperature of the treatment area was detected by a temperature needle punctured into the tumor. The blood samples of animals were obtained after treatment for evaluating the liver function. Tumor cell necrosis and apoptotic rates were observed after treatment by histological examination. CEUS showed that although perfusion defects appeared in all the treatment groups, especially in the MEUS + MWA group, there was no significant difference between the two groups on the volumes of perfusion defects, which were 1.78 ± 0.31 (cm3) in the MWA group and 1.84 ± 0.20 (cm3) in the combined group (P < 0.01). The time to reach the peak temperature of the treatment area was 21.7 ± 5.0 (s) in the MWA group and 10.3 ± 5.0 (s) in the MEUS + MWA group (P < 0.01). The time to reach the peak temperature of the treatment area was 21.7 ± 5.0 (s) in the MWA group and 10.3 ± 5.0 (s) in the MEUS + MWA group (P < 0.01). The time to reach the peak temperature of the treatment area was 21.7 ± 5.0 (s) in the MWA group and 10.3 ± 5.0 (s) in the MEUS + MWA group (. These results suggested MEUS treatment alone may significantly reduce tumor blood perfusion and led to a sharp rise in the local temperature of the treatment area to a higher PT using MEUS + MWA with higher rates of necrosis and apoptosis of cancer cells without severe liver function damage, which might be a safe strategy for treating HCC. \n",

As a member of circRNAs, ciRS-7 is thought to be a negative prognostic indicator in multiple types of cancer. The present study aimed to comprehensively explore the value of ciRS-7 in tumor malignancy. Materials and Methods. A systematic review of PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library was carried out to examine the related studies. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from the available publications by STATA 12.0. Subgroup analysis, publication bias, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression were conducted. This meta-analysis included 1,714 patients from 13 cohorts. The results suggested that high ciRS-7 expression was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.50-3.15, P < 0.001) in various cancers. Stratified analyses indicated that elevated levels of ciRS-7 appeared to be a powerful prognostic biomarker for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (HR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.07-6.07, P < 0.001) in various cancers.

In this study, RNA-Seq and data analysis using CLC Genomics Workbench was employed to identify biomarkers associated with horn cancer. As a result, a total of 149 genes were found significant differentially expressed in horn cancer samples compared to horn normal samples. The study revealed 'keratins' and 'interleukins' as apex groups of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional analysis showed that the upregulated keratins support metastasis of tumor via cell proliferation, migration, and affecting cell stability, while downregulated interleukins along with other associated chemokine receptors deprive the immune response to tumor posing clear path for metastasis of horn cancer.

We recently reported that 4-[4-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)phenoxy]phenol (4-HPPP), a phenoxyphenol, exerts antihepatoma effects by inducing apoptosis and autophagy. In this study, we further examined the effect of 4-HPPP and its analogs on NSCLC cells. Colony formation assays showed that 4-HPPP exerts selective cytotoxicity against NSCLC H1299 cells; furthermore, the inhibitory effect of 4-HPPP on the proliferation and migration of NSCLC cells was validated using an in vivo zebrafish-based tumor xenograft assay. The flow cytometry-based dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assays indicated that 4-HPPP caused an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in NSCLC cells, and Western blot assays showed that the major ROS scavenging enzymes superoxide dismutases- (SODs-) 1/2 were upregulated, whereas peroxidase (PRX) was downregulated. Furthermore, 4-HPPP caused both aneuploidization and the accumulation of γH2AX, a sensor of DNA damage, as well as the activation of double-strand break (DSB) markers, especially Ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) in NSCLC cells. Our present work suggests that the antiproliferative effects of 4-HPPP on lung cancer cells could be due to its phenoxyphenol structure, and 4-HPPP could be a candidate molecule for treating NSCLC by modulating ROS levels and lowering the threshold of polyploidy-specific cell death in the future. \n",

Therefore, the presence of active necroinflammation in the liver suggests that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients are in urgent need of treatment. Unfortunately, alanine transaminase (ALT), a routine indicator of liver inflammatory damage, showed a poor performance in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients. Thus, it will be valuable to find an alternative indicator to identify patients with hepatic necroinflammatory damage. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic value of serum Golgi protein 73 (GP73) for hepatic necroinflammatory damage in patients with NASH. The clinical data of 201 patients with NASH diagnosed by liver biopsy according to the Brunt staging system were collected retrospectively. The in situ expression of GP73 protein was measured by immunohistochemistry. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to calculate the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of serum GP73 for diagnosing hepatic necroinflammatory damage. The serum GP73 levels of NASH patients increased with the aggravation of liver necroinflammation. The median levels significantly increased from 49.98 ng/ml (31.49, 75.05) for G0-1 to 76.61 ng/ml (48.68, 110.03) for G2 and to 116.44 ng/ml (103.41, 162.17) for G3 patients (G0-1 vs. G2, P < 0.0001; G2 vs. G2, P < 0.0001; G2.

A recent study reported that CCBE1 was overexpressed in epithelial colorectal cancer (CRC) cells; however, the role of CCBE1 in tumor lymphangiogenesis and the mechanism underlying dysregulated CCBE1 expression in CRC remain undefined. Methods: The role of CCBE1 in tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis was investigated using human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs) model in vitro, and a hindfoot lymphatic metastasis model in vivo. Immunochemistry analysis was performed to assess CCBE1 expression, prognostic value and correlation with clinicopathological characteristics in CRC. The biochemical function and transcriptional regulatory mechanism of CCBE1 were explored by western blot, qPCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Results: Cancer cell-derived CCBE1 enhances VEGFC proteolysis in vitro, facilitates tube formation and migration of HLECs in vitro, and promotes tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in vivo. In addition to CRC cells, tumor stroma within CRC tissue shows high CCBE1 expression, which is associated with high lymphatic vessel density, increased lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) express and secret CCBE1, thereby contributing to VEGFC maturation and tumor lymphangiogenesis in CRC. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) downregulates the transcription and lymphangiogenic function of CCBE1 in CAFs and CRC cells through direct binding of SMADs to CCBE1 gene locus. Inactivation of the TGF-β pathway correlates with increased CCBE1 expression in CRC. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the protumorigenic role of CCBE1 in promoting lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in CRC, revealing a new mechanism by which loss of TGF-β signaling promotes CRC metastasis. \n",

We aimed to determine the prognostic value of pre-treatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based radiomic score for disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with early-stage (IB-IIA) cervical cancer. Methods: A total of 248 patients with early-stage cervical cancer underwent radical hysterectomy were included from two institutions between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017, whose MR imaging data, clinicopathological data and DFS data were collected. Patients data were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 166) and the validation cohort (n=82). Radiomic features were extracted from the pre-treatment T2-weighted (T2w) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CET1w) MR imagings for each patient. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and Cox proportional hazard model were applied to construct radiomic score (Rad-score). According to the cutoff of Rad-score, patients were divided into low- and high- risk groups. Pearson's correlation and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to evaluate the association of Rad-score with DFS. A combined model incorporating Rad-score, lymph node metastasis (LNM) and lymphovascular space invasion (LVI) by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was constructed to estimate DFS individually. Results: Higher Rad-scores were significantly associated with worse DFS in the training and validation cohorts (P<0.001 and P=0.011, respectively). The Rad-score demonstrated better prognostic performance in estimating DFS (C-index, 0.753; 95% CI: 0.696-0.805) than the clinicopathological features (C-index, 0.632; 95% CI: 0.567-0.700). However, the combined model showed no significant improvement (C-index, 0.714; 95%CI: 0.642-0.784). Conclusion: The results demonstrated that MRI-derived Rad-score can be used as a prognostic biomarker for patients with early-stage (IB-IIA) cervical cancer, which can facilitate clinical decision-making. \n",

Both tumors often show overexpression of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). In prostate cancer, PSMA-ligands labeled with 68Ga or 177Lu are used for imaging and therapy, respectively. Primary aim of this study in R/M ACC and SDC patients was to systematically investigate 68Ga-PSMA-uptake by PET/CT imaging to determine if PSMA radionuclide therapy could be a treatment option. Methods: In a prospective phase II study, PET/CT imaging was performed 1 h post injection of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC in 15 ACC patients and 10 SDC patients. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUV) were determined in tumor lesions. Immunohistochemical PSMA expression was scored in primary tumors and metastatic tissue. Standard imaging (MRI or CT) was performed for comparison. Results: In ACC patients, SUVmax ranged from 1.1 to 30.2 with a tumor/liver-ratio >1 in 13 out of 14 evaluable patients (93%). In SDC patients, SUVmax ranged from 0.3 to 25.9 with a tumor/liver-ratio >1 in 4 out of 10 patients (40%). We found a large intra-patient inter-metastatic variation in uptake of 68Ga-PSMA, and immunohistochemistry did not predict ligand uptake in ACC and SDC. Finally, PSMA-PET detected additional bone metastases compared to CT in 2 ACC patients with unexplained pain. Conclusion: In 93% of ACC patients and 40% of SDC patients we detected relevant PSMA-ligand uptake, which warrants to study PSMA radionuclide therapy in these patients. Additionally, our data provide arguments for patient selection and treatment timing. Finally, PSMA-PET imaging has added diagnostic value compared to CT in selected patients. \n",

Approximately one-third of ZFPs are Krüppel-associated box domain (KRAB)-ZFPs. Methods: ZNF471 expression and methylation were detected by reverse-transcription PCR and methylation-specific PCR. The impact and mechanism of ectopic ZNF471 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results: We identified a 19q13 KRAB-ZFP, ZNF471, as a methylated target in ESCC. We further found that ZNF471 is significantly downregulated in ESCC tissues compared with adjacent non-cancer tissues, due to its aberrant promoter CpG methylation, and further confirmed by methylation analysis and treatment with demethylation agent. Restoration of ZNF471 expression in silenced ESCC cells significantly altered cell morphology, induced apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest, and inhibited tumor cell colony formation, viability, migration and invasion. Importantly, ZNF471 was found to activate the expression of MAPK10/JNK3 and PCDH family genes, and further enhance MAPK10 signaling and downstream gene expression through binding to the MAPK10/JNK3 promoter. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that ZNF471 is an important tumor suppressor and loss of ZNF471 functions hampers MAPK10/JNK3 signaling during esophageal carcinogenesis. \n",

In line with its function at the crossroads of both processes, overexpression of CD98hc is clinically observed in various cancer malignancies, thus rendering it a promising tumor target. Methods: We describe the development of Anticalin proteins based on the lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) scaffold against the human CD98hc ectodomain (hCD98hcED) using directed evolution and protein design. X-ray structural analysis was performed to identify the epitope recognized by the lead Anticalin candidate. The Anticalin - with a tuned plasma half-life using PASylation® technology - was labeled with 89Zr and investigated by positron emission tomography (PET) of CD98-positive tumor xenograft mice. Results: The Anticalin P3D11 binds CD98hc with picomolar affinity and recognizes a protruding loop structure surrounded by several glycosylation sites within the solvent exposed membrane-distal part of the hCD98hcED. In vitro studies revealed specific binding activity of the Anticalin towards various CD98hc-expressing human tumor cell lines, suggesting broader applicability in cancer research. PET/CT imaging of mice bearing human prostate carcinoma xenografts using the optimized and 89Zr-labeled Anticalin demonstrated strong and specific tracer accumulation (8.6 ± 1.1 %ID/g) as well as a favorable tumor-to-blood ratio of 11.8. Conclusion: Our findings provide a first proof of concept to exploit CD98hc for non-invasive biomedical imaging. The novel Anticalin-based αhCD98hc radiopharmaceutical constitutes a promising tool for preclinical and, potentially, clinical applications in oncology. \n",

One prominent aspect of PDAC that contributes to its aggressive behavior is its altered cellular metabolism. The aim of this study was to characterize the oncogenic effects of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein I (UQCRC1), a key component of mitochondrial complex III, in PDAC development and to assess its potential as a therapeutic target for PDAC. Experimental Design: The expression of UQCRC1 in human PDAC tissues and p48-Cre/p53Flox/WT/LSL-KrasG12D (KPC) mouse pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) was determined by immunohistochemistry. The role of UQCRC1 in promoting PDAC growth was evaluated in vitro in PANC-1 and CFPAC-1 cells and in vivo in transplanted mouse models of PDAC. Extracellular flux and RNA-Seq analyses were applied to investigate the mechanism of UQCRC1 in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and PDAC cell growth. The therapeutic potential of UQCRC1 in PDAC was assessed by knockdown of UQCRC1 using an RNA interference approach. Results: UQCRC1 expression showed a gradual increase during the progression from PanIN stages to PDAC in KPC mice. Elevated expression of UQCRC1 was observed in 72.3% of PDAC cases and was correlated with poor prognosis of the disease. UQCRC1 promoted PDAC cell growth in both in vitro experiments and in vivo subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models. UQCRC1 overexpression resulted in increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and ATP production. The overproduced ATP was released into the extracellular space via the pannexin 1 channel and then functioned as an autocrine or paracrine agent to promote cell proliferation through the ATP/P2Y2-RTK/AKT axis. UQCRC1 knockdown or ATP release blockage could effectively inhibit PDAC growth. Conclusion: UQCRC1 has a protumor function and may serve as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for PDAC. \n",

Our clinical study included patients who were diagnosed with CRC clinically or pathologically. Patients were divided into TCM treatment group and control group according to whether the modified Anti-cancer Decoction II Formula was applied for more than six months. Propensity score matching (hereinafter referred to as PSM) was used to further balance the covariates between groups. One-year to six-year progression-free survival rates of the two groups and the median progression-free survival (mPFS), median overall survival (mOS) of the two groups before and after PSM were calculated respectively. Furthermore, 15 factors that may affect the mPFS in CRC were included in COX multivariate regression analysis to explore the prognostic factors related to CRC as well as to analyze the risk ratio of different subgroups. A total of 529 CRC patients were included in our study, 285 patients were in the TCM treatment group and 244 patients were in the control group. Before PSM, the mPFS and mOS in the TCM treatment group were 68 months and 75 months respectively, while mPFS and mOS in the control group were 40 months and 65 months respectively. After PSM, mPFS and mOS in the TCM treatment group were both 75 months, while mPFS and mOS in the control group were 28 months and 44 months respectively. One-year to six-year progression-free survival rates were 94.0%, 76.1%, 64.7%, 57.9%, 52.0%, 44.1% respectively in the TCM treatment group, and 78.6%, 61.4%, 51.7%, 40.8%, 33.0%, 29.1% respectively in the control group (p < 0.01). COX multivariate regression analysis indicated that surgery, chemotherapy and taking Chinese herbal decoction were protective factors for CRC recurrence and metastasis, while combining with intestinal obstruction, drinking history and family history were independent factors for CRC recurrence and metastasis. The results of subgroup analysis showed that the decoction of TCM could reduce the risk of recurrence and metastasis in each subgroup (p < 0.01).

Advanced liver fibrosis leads to cirrhosis and liver failure. Nilotinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which showed antifibrotic efficacy. Stem cell therapy still has some limitations such as oncogenesis, unexpected differentiation, and ethical consideration. Stem cells secrete cytokines and growth factors that showed paracrine-mediated antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro. Thus, stem cell-conditioned medium (SC-CM), which contains the secretory proteins of stem cells, may have an antifibrotic role. This study was carried out to examine the antifibrotic effect of Nilotinib and stem cell exosomes on CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in rats. Male Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with CCl4 twice a week for 9 weeks and given daily treatments of Nilotinib (20 mg/kg), stem cell exosomes (0.5 ml/rat), and the combination treatment of Nilotinib and stem cell exosomes during the last 5 weeks of CCl4 intoxication. Liver fibrosis and also antifibrotic efficacy of the treatments were estimated with liver function tests, oxidative stress parameters, apoptotic parameters, histopathological examination, and hydroxyproline contents. Results showed that the combination of Nilotinib and stem cell-conditioned media had more antifibrotic effects than each one alone (P value < 0.001). \n",

Reliable biomarkers are urgently needed to make risk stratifications for pNEN patients, which could be beneficial to the development of individualized therapeutic strategy in the clinical practice. Here, we aimed to evaluate the predictive and prognostic roles of serum alkaline phosphatase-to-albumin ratio (APAR) in well-differentiated pNEN patients. We retrospectively analyzed the pathologically confirmed grade 1/2 pNEN patients, who were originally treated in our hospital from February 2008 to April 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the value of APAR in detecting synchronous metastases and predicting relapses following curative resections. A total of 170 eligible cases were included into analysis. Logistic univariate analysis indicated APAR (P=0.002) was significantly associated with synchronous distant metastasis among well-differentiated pNEN patients, which was further demonstrated to be an independent risk factor by multivariate analysis (odds ratio 8.127, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.105-31.372, P=0.002) was significantly associated with synchronous distant metastasis among well-differentiated pNEN patients, which was further demonstrated to be an independent risk factor by multivariate analysis (odds ratio 8.127, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.105-31.372, P=0.002) was significantly associated with synchronous distant metastasis among well-differentiated pNEN patients, which was further demonstrated to be an independent risk factor by multivariate analysis (odds ratio 8.127, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.105-31.372, P=0.002) was significantly associated with synchronous distant metastasis among well-differentiated pNEN patients, which was further demonstrated to be an independent risk factor by multivariate analysis (odds ratio 8.127, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.105-31.372, P=0.002) was significantly associated with synchronous distant metastasis among well-differentiated pNEN patients, which was further demonstrated to be an independent risk factor by multivariate analysis (odds ratio 8.127, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.105-31.372. APAR may work as a convenient pretreatment marker to detect synchronous distant metastasis for well-differentiated pNEN patients and predict recurrences for curatively resected cases without nerve or vascular invasion. However, these findings should be further verified in prospectively well-designed studies. \n",

However, the expression pattern and biologic significance of TET in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the biological functions of TET1 and the miRNA and mRNA expression levels in PTC cells with downregulated TET1. The expression of the TET family in 49 PTC tissues and corresponding tumor-adjacent tissues, as well as PTC cell lines (BCPAP, K1, and TPC-1) and the normal thyroid epithelial cell line (Nthy-ori 3-1), were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The 5hmC level was detected in PTC tissues and cell lines using immunohistochemistry and dot blot assay, respectively. After silencing the TET1 gene with siRNAs in BCPAP and TPC-1 cells, cell proliferation was detected using EdU assay. Transwell assay was used to investigate cell migration and invasion. miRNA and mRNA expression arrays were conducted in TET1-depleted BCPAP cells. The expression level of TET1 decreased in PTC tissues and cell lines and was consistent with the reduction in the 5hmC level. The knockdown of the TET1 gene with siRNAs in BCPAP and TPC-1 cells, cell proliferation was detected using EdU assay. Transwell assay was used to investigate cell migration and invasion. miRNA and mRNA expression arrays were conducted in TET1-depleted BCPAP cells. WNT4, FZD4, CDK6, MCF2L, and EDN1 was upregulated as potential target genes of dysregulated miRNAs. The study showed that TET1 dysfunction inhibited the migration and invasion of BCPAP cells and might have a potential role in the pathogenesis of PTC. \n",

Treatment of NEN patients remains challenging due to lack of prospective evidence on the choice of ideal therapeutic sequence and therapeutic efficacy in specific individual scenarios. Clinical data on 110 consecutive patients suffering from NEN treated at a single German university center were analyzed, therapeutic regimens applied were assessed, and the outcome was evaluated. Histological grading, Ki67 proliferation index, functional activity, and presence of metastases were identified as prognostic markers. 10-year overall survival rates were 92%, 44%, and 0% for G1, G2, and G3 tumors, and 60%, 39%, 69%, 53%, and 0% for Ki67 <2%, 3-5%, 6-20%, 21-49%, and >50%, respectively. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and cytostatic chemotherapy were the second most common options, with PRRT being used more frequently in NET G1 and G2 and chemotherapy in NEC G3. Combination chemotherapy with etoposide plus cisplatin or carboplatin showed disease control rates (DCRs) of overall 74%, with a short median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7 or 5 months, respectively. DCR and PFS for PRRT were 89% and 22 months when administered as monotherapy, versus 100% and 27 months upon combination with somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy. Of note, PRRT also achieved disease control as best response in 5/5 (100%) selected cases of NEC G3.

Variants in the gene encoding tight junction protein-2 (TJP2) have been linked to PFIC type 4 (PFIC4), which predominantly presents in childhood. However, there are only limited data from adults with TJP2-related PFIC4. We report a family with an autosomal recessive disorder with a novel variant in the TJP2 gene in adults with very variable expression of PFIC4. The index patient presented at 19 years old with liver cirrhosis and variceal bleeding and was treated with endoscopic banding and beta-blockers. In 2018, he developed primary liver cancer that was treated with radiofrequency ablation followed by liver transplantation in 2019. Genetic testing revealed a novel homozygous TJP2 variant causing PFIC4 (TJP2([NM_004817.3]:c.[3334C>T]; [3334C>T])). The consanguineous family consists of the father and mother (both heterozygous) and their 12 children, of which five carry the variant in a homozygous state; however, these five siblings have highly variable expression of PFIC4. Two homozygous brothers had cirrhosis and portal hypertension at diagnosis at the ages of 19 and 36. Two other homozygous brothers, age 23 and 19, and the homozygous sister, age 21, have elevated liver enzymes but presently no cirrhosis, which may suggest an age-dependent penetrance. In addition, five sisters had severe and mild intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and carry the TJP2 variant in a homozygous and heterozygous state, respectively. This novel TJP2 variant is associated with PFIC4 causing severe liver disease with cirrhosis and primary liver cancer in adolescents/adults. \n",

To investigate the effect of miR-34c and its upstream transcription factor E2F1 on paclitaxel combined with cisplatin resistance in GC cells. Paired GC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were randomly sampled from 74 GC patients. miR-34c and E2F1 were detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot. In addition, the drug resistance of GC cells to paclitaxel and cisplatin was induced by concentration gradient increasing methods, and changes in miR-34c and E2F1 during this process were measured. Furthermore, E2F1 and miR-34c overexpression or underexpression vectors were constructed and transfected into drug-resistant GC cells. MTT was employed to test the sensitivity of cells to paclitaxel combined with cisplatin, qPCR was adopted to detect the expression of miR-34c, Western blot was applied to detect the expression levels of E2F1, drug resistance-related proteins and apoptosis-related proteins, and flow cytometry was used for the determination of cell apoptosis and cell cycle status. E2F1 was overexpressed while miR-34c was underexpressed in GC. After inducing GC cells to be resistant to paclitaxel and cisplatin, E2F1 expression increased while miR-34c expression decreased. Both silencing E2F1 and over-expressing miR-34c could increase the sensitivity of drug-resistant GC cells to paclitaxel combined with cisplatin, promote cell apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation. Among which, silencing E2F1 could reduce the expression of drug resistance-related proteins and apoptosis-related proteins, while over-expression of miR-34c could upregulate the expression of apoptosis-related proteins without affecting the expression of MDR-1, MRP and other drug resistance-related proteins. Rescue experiments demonstrated that inhibiting miR-34c could significantly weaken the sensitization of drug resistant cells, and Si E2F1 to paclitaxel combined with cisplatin. E2F1 inhibits miR-34c to promote the proliferation of GC cells and enhance the resistance to paclitaxel combined with cisplatin, and silencing E2F1 is conducive to improving the efficacy of paclitaxel combined with cisplatin in GC cells. \n",

Because Aβ reduces the integrity of the blood-brain barrier we have examined its potential role in regulating the sinusoidal permeability of normal and cirrhotic liver. Aβ and key proteins that generate (beta-secretase 1 and presenilin-1) and degrade it (neprilysin and myelin basic protein) were decreased in human cirrhotic liver. In culture, activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) internalized Aβ more efficiently than astrocytes and HSC degraded Aβ leading to suppressed expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen 1 and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). Aβ also upregulated sinusoidal permeability marker endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and decreased TGFβ in cultured human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (hLSEC). Liver Aβ levels also correlate with the expression of eNOS in transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice and in human and rodent cirrhosis/fibrosis. These findings suggest a previously unexplored role of Aβ in the maintenance of liver sinusoidal permeability and in protection against cirrhosis/fibrosis via attenuation of HSC activation. \n",

Nevertheless, the role of circ-PRMT5 in HCC remains largely unknown. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to assess the expression levels of circ-PRMT5, miR-188-5p and anti-Hexokinase II (HK2) in HCC tissues and cells. The cell proliferation, migration and glycolysis were determined by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazol-3-ium bromide (MTT), transwell migration assay, and indicated kits, respectively. The interaction relationship between miR-188-5p and circ-PRMT5 or HK2 was analyzed by the bioinformatics database, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. The western blot assay was used to analyze the expression level of HK2. The functional role of circ-PRMT5 in vivo was assessed by a xenograft experiment. Circ-PRMT5 was elevated in HCC tissues and cells than matched control groups. Furthermore, loss-of-functional experiments revealed that the silencing of circ-PRMT5 could repress proliferation, migration, glycolysis in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, we also confirmed that overexpression of circ-PRMT5 abolished the effects on HCC cells induced by upregulating miR-188-5p. In addition, overexpression of miR-188-5p could repress the development of HCC. More importantly, HK2 was a target gene of miR-188-5p, and miR-188-5p regulated proliferation, migration, glycolysis of HCC cells by specifically binding to HK2. Mechanistically, circ-PRMT5 could act as a sponge of miR-188-5p to regulate the expression of HK2. In summary, circ-PRMT5 might play a key role in proliferation, migration, glycolysis of HCC cells via miR-188-5p/HK2 axis, which indicated that circ-PRMT5 might be a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment. \n",

Primary outcomes included locoregional disease control, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier outcome analyses were performed. Of the 159 resected patients, the majority had lobectomy (82.4%), followed by pneumonectomy (11.9%) and sublobar resection (5.7%). The 30- and 90-day mortality rates were 0.6% and 1.3%, respectively. At median follow-up of 52.8 months, recurrence was 55.3%, with 44.0% having distant and 15.1% locoregional recurrence. At 5 years, OS was 50.8% and DFS was 33.1% Median OS was 61.2 months. A total of 366 patients underwent dCRT, with intensity-modulated radiation in 64.5%, proton therapy in 26.0%, and 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in 9.6%. The mean dose was 68.1 Gy. At median follow-up of 20.8 months, recurrence was 53.6%, with distant and locoregional recurrence of 40.7% and 30.3%, respectively. At 5 years, OS was 29.2% and DFS was 20.5%. Median OS was 27.5 months. Stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC continues to be a heterogeneous disease, and patients with surgically resected and unresected disease represent different risk populations. Ongoing immunotherapy trials may further redefine treatment algorithms in this complex patient population. \n",

There are currently three possible strategies for curative management of sCRLM: \"classic\", \"combined\", and \"liver-first\". The aim of our research was to analyze the effects of the three surgical management strategies for sCRLM on postoperative morbidity and mortality and overall and recurrence-free survival. Patients treated for sCRLM between October 2000 and May 2015 were included. We defined three groups: (1) \"classic\": surgery of primary tumor and then surgery of sCRLM; (2) \"combined\": combined surgery of primary tumor and sCRLM: and (3) \"liver-first\": surgery of sCRLM and then surgery of primary tumor. During this period, 170 patients who underwent 209 hepatectomies were included (\"classic\": 149, \"combined\": 34, \"liver-first\": 26). The rate of severe complications was higher in the \"combined\" group compared to the \"classic\" group (35% vs. 12%, P=0.03), and the \"liver-first\" group (35% vs. 19%, P=0.25), while there were significantly fewer liver resections. Overall survival at 5 years in our cohort was 46%, without significant differences between the groups, and a median survival of 54 months. Recurrence-free survival of the patients in our cohort was 24% at 5 years, with a median survival time without recurrence of 14 months, without significant differences between the groups. All three strategies were feasible and there were no differences regarding overall and recurrence-free survivals between the three approaches. The \"combined\" strategy group had significantly more severe complications and did not provide better oncological results, despite less aggressive liver disease and more limited liver resections. \n",

Bevacizumab plus FOLFOX-4 (oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and infusional 5-fluorouracil) is among standard first-line treatment options in this setting. We performed a phase II randomized trial in order to evaluate the activity of bevacizumab plus either FOLFOX-4 or XELOX-2 in first-line therapy of patients with mCRC. Patients with mCRC were randomized, in a 1:2 ratio, to first-line bevacizumab plus either FOLFOX-4 (Arm A), as calibration arm, or XELOX-2 (Arm B), up to 12 cycles. Patients without progression were further randomized to maintenance bevacizumab alone or with the same induction fluoropyrimidine. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. The study design was formally non-comparative, but exploratory comparison was performed. Forty-five patients were randomized in arm A and 87 in arm B with an ORR of 55.6% versus 48.3% (P = .43), respectively. After a median follow-up of 47.2 months, progression-free survival was 10.0 versus 9.9 months (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.41; P = .84) and overall survival was 29.8 versus 25.0 months (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.92; P = .41), respectively. The main grade 3 to 4 toxicities (% A/B) were: neutropenia 15/3 and nausea 9/5. This exploratory analysis showed that biweekly XELOX-2 plus bevacizumab has a comparable ORR with FOLFOX-4 plus bevacizumab in patients with mCRC. \n",

This study evaluates survival outcomes in patients with metastatic breast cancer after receiving LRT (surgery and/or radiation therapy) of the primary tumor. The National Cancer Database was used to identify 16,128 qualifying cases of metastatic breast cancer who received systemic therapy with or without LRT from 2004 to 2013. Treatment modality was divided into surgery (Sx), radiation therapy (RT), surgery followed by RT (Sx + RT), and no LRT. The median survival and 3-year actuarial survival rates (OS) were analyzed for each treatment group. On multivariate analyses, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using Cox regression modeling to adjust for patient and clinicopathologic characteristics. Overall, the median follow-up was 28.3 months, and the median survival for all patients was 37.2 months. With 9761 deaths reported, the estimated 3-year OS was 51.3%. The Sx + RT group (n = 2166) had the highest 3-year OS of 69.4%, followed by the Sx group (n = 4293) with 57.6%, the no LRT group (n = 8955) with 44.3%, and the RT group (n = 714) with 41.5% (P < .0001). On multivariate analysis, compared with the no LRT group, a decreased HR was noted in patients receiving Sx (adjusted HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.65-0.71; P < .0001) and Sx + RT (adjusted HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.43-0.49; P < .0001). LRT, especially surgery followed by RT, in addition to systemic therapy, was associated with improved survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. \n",

Twenty-seven patients with N0 early oral tongue cancer underwent CTL with a 128-slice multi-detector row CT scanner to detect SLN on the day before resection of primary tumor and SLN biopsy under ICG fluorescence guidance. We identified the location and number of SLNs mapped by CTL and evaluated whether CTL-enhanced SLNs could be identified intraoperatively as ICG fluorescent lymph nodes. Prognosis was also evaluated. SLNs were detected by CTL in 26 of 27 patients (96.3%). The total and mean numbers of SLNs were 41 and 1.5, respectively. All SLNs enhanced by CTL could be identified intraoperatively as ICG fluorescent lymph nodes. Two SLNs were found under ICG fluorescent guidance in only one patient without SLN enhanced by CTL. Among the 27 patients, five (18.5%) had SLN with metastasis. Median follow-up was 76 months (range 44-82 months). During follow-up, three of 22 patients without SLN metastasis had occult cervical lymph node metastasis. The 5-year overall survival rate was 100%. SLN biopsy with preoperative CTL and intraoperative ICG fluorescence imaging is a feasible and reliable procedure, without radioisotope tracers, for neck management in cases of early tongue cancer. \n",

Herein, our aim is to highlight the frequency of all clinicopathological characteristics of this rare tumor based in our series and the available medical (PubMed) literature. 42 cases were evaluated for: tissue layers involved by the tumor (in skin and mucosae), growth pattern, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic index, necrosis, spindling, calcification, hyalinization, and pustule-ovoid bodies of Milian, as well as perineural and vascular invasion, and the presence of adjacent epithelium changes, and lymphocytes and eosinophils infiltration., Follow-up was analyzed. The tumors were subclassified into benign, atypical and malignant according to Fanburg-Smith criteria and into benign or GCT of uncertain malignant potential according to Nasser criteria. The same characteristics were analyzed for 1499 cases reviewed according to PRISMA guidelines. In the current series, the mean age at diagnosis was 45.8 years (range 6-69 years). Most patients were females (60 %) and the involved organs were by descending frequency: skin and subcutaneous tissue, bronchus, esophagus, breast, tongue, larynx, pharynx, gingiva, trachea, right colon, vulva, and hypopharynx. No recurrence or progression was seen, despite 32 cases were incompletely excised, with the exception of one malignant tumor. The growth pattern was either infiltrative (85.71 %) or well limited (7.14 %). Sixteen tumors had vesicular nuclei. Mitotic activity was found in two tumors. Lymphocytic infiltration was found in 14 tumors. Eosinophils were present in 6 cases. One GCT of the right colon showed extensive calcification and hyalinization. Perineural invasion was noted in 6 lesions. No vascular invasion was found. One tumor was clinically malignant and the patient died 2 years after diagnosis. Medical literature review showed similar results in terms of frequency of the reported clinical and morphological features. Among cases with available follow up, almost 20 % showed positive margins and of those 20 % developed local recurrence. According to the Fanburg-Smith criteria, 72 % would be benign, 17 % atypical and 11 % malignant tumors, while according to those of Nasser, 93 % would be benign and 7% of uncertain malignant potential. However, true malignancy, as affirmed by metastasis of GCT is found in almost 2.5 % of the cases. GCT is a usually benign tumor, affecting any anatomic location. Necrosis and mitotic activity seem to be the most effective histologic criteria for detecting aggressive tumors, but the presence of metastasis (2.5 % of the cases) remains the most accepted definitive criterion for diagnosis of malignant GCT. \n",

RAS/RAF mutations importantly contribute to colorectal tumorigenesis since they remain the activated status of downstream pathways without regulation of the upstream EGFR signal. However, it has not been unclear how epigenetic alterations involved in colorectal tumorigenesis mediated by KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutations. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the frequency and distribution of KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations in Vietnamese colorectal cancer (CRC) and explored the relationship between genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in 156 tumors of CRC. Somatic mutations of KRAS (exon 2, codon 12/13; exon 3, codon 61), NRAS (exon 2, codon 12/13; exon 3, codon 61), and BRAF (exon 15, codon 600) was determined by Cobas® KRAS Mutation Test, Therascreen NRAS Pyro Kit and Cobas® 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test, respectively. Methylation status of BRCA1, MLH1, MGMT, p16, RASSF1A, and APC was detected by methylation-specific PCR. Distribution of each abnormality in clinicopathological features was also analyzed. Results showed the mutation rates of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were 41.0 %, 9.6 %, 8.3 % respectively, while the methylation rates of BRCA1, MLH1, MGMT, p16, RASSF1A, and APC were 16.7 %, 16.7 %, 32.7 %, 30.1 %, 30.1 %, and 37.2 % respectively. The distribution of KRAS mutation was mutually exclusive against that of NRAS (p <  0.001) and BRAF (p <  0.001) mutations in CRC. RAS/RAF mutations were more common in adenocarcinoma subtype (p =  0.020), whereas RASSF1A methylation was more frequent in mucinous adenocarcinoma subtype (p =  0.007). In addition, the frequency of having KRAS mutations was significantly higher in MGMT (p =  0.035) or RASSF1A (p =  0.043) methylated cases than in those without methylation. BRAF mutations were positively associated with MLH1 hypermethylation (p =  0.028) but were inversely associated with APC hypermethylation (p =  0.032). Overall, our results show specific interactions of genetic and epigenetic alterations and suggest the presence of independent oncogenic pathways in tumorigenesis of CRC. \n",

However, the protein expression profiles of E2 F family cell cycle regulators in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we aimed to examine the protein expression profiles and prognostic value of E2 F1, E2 F3, and E2 F4 in ccRCC cases. The immunohistochemical expression of E2 F1, E2 F3, and E2 F4 was quantitatively scored in 180 ccRCC tumor tissues and 79 normal kidney tissues. The prognostic implications of these E2 F members were determined. We found that ccRCC tumor cells showed higher nuclear expression of E2 F1, E2 F3 and E2 F4 than normal kidney samples. High E2 F1 and E2 F3 expression in tumor cells was associated with poor prognostic factors of ccRCC, whereas high E2 F4 correlated with beneficial prognostic factors. High expression of E2 F1 and E2 F3 in tumor cells was correlated with a poor overall and recurrence-free survival, while high E2 F4 expression did not. In conclusion, E2 F1, E2 F3 and E2 F4 may function as oncogenes during tumorigenesis of ccRCC, although they contribute to the progression of ccRCC in different ways. Additional studies are required to clarify the conflicting role of E2 F4 in the tumor evolution of ccRCC. \n",

Serum samples of 41 CHC patients and 18 normal participants were collected to examine the expression levels of miR-34a using qRT-PCR. The changes of serum TBA, liver enzyme AST and ALT were also determined by enzyme colorimetry and rate method. The levels of serum fibrotic markers hyaluronic acid (HA), type III procollagen (PCIII), type IV collagen (IV-C) and laminin (LN) were detected by radioimmunoassay. Degree of liver fibrosis was examined by liver biopsy. Western blot analysis was used to investigate the expression of ac-p53, p53 and Sirt1 in the liver tissues of CHC patients. MiR-34a was significantly increased in the serum of CHC patients than that in healthy participants, and serum miR-34a was correlated with liver fibrosis index. Serum TBA, AST and ALT levels, and AST/ALT ratios in patients with CHC were increased with increasing degree of fibrosis, and were positively associated with serum miR-34a. Furthermore, the liver tissues of CHC patients showed low Sirt1 protein expression and highly ac-p53 protein expression. Serum miR-34a in patients with CHC could promote liver fibrosis through mediating the Sirt1/p53 pathway and might function as pivotal biomarker on the prognosis and diagnosis of CHC patients. \n",

Between 2016 and 2018, we identified 1045 metastatic GC patients who received palliative fluoropyrimidine/platinum-based chemotherapy and underwent tumor genomic profiling at a tertiary hospital in Korea and two US cancer centers. We retrospectively identified FGFR2-amplified cases and abstracted clinicopathologic features and treatment outcomes. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to evaluate the variables that demonstrated effects on progression free and overall survival PFS and OS. Descriptive statistics were used to correlate level of FGFR2 copy number amplification CNA and clinicopathological parameters. The incidence of FGFR2-amplified GC was 4.0 %. A total of 42 FGFR2-amplified GC patients were included and divided into high and lower FGFR2 amplification values. Fifteen patients had an FGFR2 CNA greater than 30, and 27 had a CNA of 30 or less. There was no signiﬁcant differences between age, sex, tumor localization, Lauren classification, or tumor staging. After a median follow-up duration of 11.4 months, patients with high FGFR2 amplification had significantly poorer median PFS (3.2 vs. 4.8 months, hazard ratio (HR) 2.08, 95 % CI, 1.03-4.22, P = 0.042) and significantly shorter median OS (10.1 vs. 26.3 months, HR 2.99, 95 % CI = 1.05-8.49, P = 0.040) than the low FGFR2 amplification group. Recurrent FGFR2 amplification was observed in roughly 4.0 % of GC patients. High FGFR2 amplification was significantly associated with poor progression free survival and overall survival in GC patients. Clinical studies of FGFR2-directed therapies are warranted and should consider stratification by FGFR2 CNA. \n",

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with unifocal versus multifocal GBM to highlight demographic differences and clinical outcomes for two groups of patients. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried (2004-2016) for patients newly diagnosed with either unifocal or multifocal GBM. Statistics included Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) analysis, along with Cox proportional hazards modeling. Of 45,268 total patients, 37,483 (82.8%) had unifocal GBM and 7,785 (17.2%) had multifocal GBM. Patients with unifocal GBM more frequently received gross total resection (GTR) (41.2% versus 25.8%, p < 0.001) and conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (RT) (48.2% versus 42.7%, p < 0.001). Patients with multifocal GBM had a higher rate of surgery with biopsy only (34.0% compared to 24.1%, p < 0.001). Median OS was 12.8 months versus 8.3 months (p < 0.001) for patients with unifocal GBM or multifocal GBM, respectively. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with improved OS included unifocal disease, MGMT methylation, RT use, and chemotherapy use. This is the largest study to date describing outcomes for patients with multifocal GBM, and it shows that multifocal GBM is associated with a decreased use both of GTR and conventionally fractionated RT, as well as worse median OS. Further research is needed to improve clinical outcomes for patients with multifocal GBM. \n",

It has been proven that liver fibrosis is reversible after the elimination of the etiology, especially in the early stage. Thus, early diagnosis of liver fibrosis is of vital importance for clinical treatment. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for both diagnosis and staging of fibrosis, but is suboptimal, due in large parts to its invasive nature and sundry associated complications. To overcome this, a number of non-invasive diagnosis based on serum biomarkers or imaging modalities have been developed. While diagnosis based on serum biomarkers is cheaper and more acceptable to patients, almost none developed to date are liver-specific, and may engender a false positive error. The imaging modalities have evolved rapidly and are taking on more and more important roles in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. \n",

Radiomic features were extracted for all patients from the preoperative contrast-enhanced abdominal CT images. Statistical analysis identified the radiomic features predicting the Ki-67 index in ACC and analysed the correlation with the Ki-67 index. Fifty-three cases of ACC that met eligibility criteria were identified and analysed. Of the radiomic features analysed, 10 showed statistically significant differences between the high and low Ki-67 expression subgroups. Multivariate linear regression analysis yielded a predictive model showing a significant association between radiomic signature and Ki-67 expression status in ACC (R2=0.67, adjusted R2=0.462, p=0.002). Further analysis of the independent predictors showed statistically significant correlation between Ki-67 expression and shape flatness, elongation, and grey-level long run emphasis (p=0.002, 0.01, and 0.04, respectively). The area under the curve for identification of high Ki-67 expression status was 0.78 for shape flatness and 0.7 for shape elongation.

As of this writing, six ACKRs have been characterized by diverse activities. They bind both cysteine-cysteine (CC) type and cysteine-X-cysteine (CXC)-type chemokines, either alone, or together with a ligand bound-functional G-protein coupled (typical) chemokine receptor. The major structural difference between ACKRs and typical chemokine receptors is the substituted DRYLAIV amino acid motif in the second intracellular loop of the ACKR. Due to this substitution, these receptors cannot bind Gαi-type G-proteins responsible for intracellular calcium mobilization and cellular chemotaxis. Although initially characterized as non-signaling transmembrane receptors (decoy receptors) that attenuate ligand-induced signaling by GPCRs, studies of all ACKRs have shown ligand-independent and ligand-dependent transmembrane signaling in both non-tumor and tumor cells. The precise function and mechanism of the differential expression of ACKRs in many tumors are not understood well. The use of antagonists of ACKRs ligands has shown limited antitumor potential; however, depleting ACKR expression resulted in a reduction in experimental tumor growth and metastasis. The ACKRs represent a unique class of transmembrane signaling proteins that regulate growth, survival, and metastatic processes in tumor cells, affecting multiple pathways of tumor growth. Therefore, closer investigations of ACKRs have a high potential for identifying therapeutics which affect the intracellular signaling, preferentially via the ligand-independent mechanism. \n",

The results showed that GAS6-AS1 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissue samples and cell lines. Increased GAS6-AS1 expression was associated with tumor size, Edmondson grade, and Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage among patients with HCC. The overall survival of patients with HCC characterized with high expression of GAS6-AS1 was significantly shorter in comparison to that of patients with low level of GAS6-AS1. Functional experiments indicated that knockdown of GAS6-AS1 suppressed HCC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro; promoted apoptosis in vitro; and decreased tumor growth in vivo. Of note, GAS6-AS1 was validated as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for microRNA-585 (miR-585) and consequently increased the expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2). Finally, rescue experiments confirmed the association among GAS6-AS1, miR-585, and EIF5A2 in HCC cells. Our study provides substantial evidence that the GAS6-AS1/miR-585/EIF5A2 pathway plays an important role in HCC progression and that might be considered as a potential target for therapeutic approaches in HCC. \n",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression level and the prognostic value of miR-22 in HCC patients.Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to evaluate serum level of miR-22 in 108 HCC patients and 67 healthy controls. The relationship between miR-22 expression level and clinicopathologic characteristics was analysed via chi-square test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was built to estimate the diagnostic value of serum miR-22 in HCC.Results: miR-22 expression was significantly down-regulated in HCC compared to that in healthy controls (p < .05). And the low miR-22 expression was significantly associated with vein invasion (p = .002), TNM stage (p = .013) and high serum levels of AFP (α-fetoprotein), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase. miR-22 had a high diagnostic value with area under the curve of 0.866 corresponding with a sensitivity of 89.3% and a specificity of 68.9%, respectively.Conclusion: miR-22 expression was down-regulated in HCC patients. Serum miR-22 might be a novel diagnostic marker in HCC. \n",
