Course description
------------------
Between Electronic Medical Records and Electronic Health Records, PubMed, and collections of biomedical grant
applications, there exist large quantities of medical information stored in databases waiting to be explored.
Besides tables of numbers, medical records also contain a great amount of free-text paragraphs that are
comprehensible by human readers but challenging to the computers. Text mining is an interdisciplinary area that
primarily combines advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Machine
Learning (ML) to help the computers understand human written language, and thus extract medical and clinical
information from free-text records. 

This class aims at introducing fundamental applications in text mining such as
named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction, passage retrieval and document classification.
The class is oriented towards hands-on experience with Python, popular text mining packages such as NLTK and spaCy, and popular machine learning packages such as scikit-learn.

Learning Objectives
-------------------
By the end of this course you should be able to:

1. Understand fundamental building blocks of text mining
2. Understand fundamental building blocks of machine learning regarding text mining applications 
3. Develop Python functions for text processing
4. Build fundamental text mining applications (hands-on experience with Python, [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/), [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/))

Assessment
--------
The assessment focuses on (1) practicing python and machine learning skills and (2) hands-on experience of text mining on real-world datasets. Details are as follows.

1. Python and machine learning skills

    By the end of the semester, you must complete [Python Programming Skill Track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/python-programming) and [Machine Learning Fundamentals with Python Skill Track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-fundamentals-with-python). 
This will take about 35 hours in total to complete. Note that you could also do other tracks if you are interested, but they are optional. **Please start the tracks as soon as possible and work towards the certificate(s) throughout the semester. This may require substantial work! Do not wait until the end of the semester!**

2. Text mining on real-world datasets

    By the end of the semester, you must also develop a text mining application on real-world datasets. You will (1) submit the codes and models to a [GitHub](https://github.com] repository, (2) write up a report to describe the method, and (3) present in the final week. More details will be released in Week 3. 


Required Materials
------------------

**Each student is encouraged to bring their laptop to each class.**

*Programing without a computer would be an exceptional feat.*

For installing Python or Python related queries, please refer to [BIOF309 Introduction to Python Programming](https://github.com/marskar/biof309_fall2018/). 


Recommended Books
-----------------
**There is no required textbook for this course.**

We do, however, highly recommend [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/) and [Applied Text Analysis with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052555.do) for understanding text mining in more depth. If you are also interested in exploring Python in more details, we recommend [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) and its companion text [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) by Jake Vanderplas.
